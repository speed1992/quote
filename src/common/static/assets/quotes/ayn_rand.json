We cannot expect their support for any endeavor of the intellect, for any goal of the spirit. They are nothing but vicious animals.

His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch – or build a cyclotron – without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think.\t“But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call ‘human nature,’ the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs, or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival – so that for you, who are a human being, the question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to think or not to think.’ . . . \t“Man has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice. . . Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him to perform. Man has the power to act as his own destroyer – and that is the way he has acted through most of his history (pages 1012-1013)."},{"id":1158,"quote":"The necessary consequence of man's right to life is his right to self-defense.

I consider marriage a very important institution, but it is important when and if two people have found the person with whom they wish to spend the rest of their lives -- a question of which no man or woman can be automatically certain. When one is certain that one's choice is final, then marriage is, of course, a desirable state. But this does not mean that any relationship based on less than total certainty is improper.

Love is a response to values. It is with a person’s sense of life that one falls in love—with that essential sum, that fundamental stand or way of facing existence, which is the essence of a personality. One falls in love with the embodiment of the values that formed a person’s character, which are reflected in his widest goals or smallest gestures, which create the style of his soul—the individual style of a unique, unrepeatable, irreplaceable consciousness. It is one’s own sense of life that acts as the selector, and responds to what it recognizes as one’s own basic values in the person of another. It is not a matter of professed convictions (though these are not irrelevant); it is a matter of much more profound, conscious and subconscious harmony.Many errors and tragic disillusionments are possible in this process of emotional recognition, since a sense of life, by itself, is not a reliable cognitive guide. And if there are degrees of evil, then one of the most evil consequences of mysticism—in terms of human suffering—is the belief that love is a matter of “the heart, not the mind, that love is an emotion independent of reason, that love is blind and impervious to the power of philosophy. Love is the expression of philosophy—of a subconscious philosophical sum—and, perhaps, no other aspect of human existence needs the conscious power of philosophy quite so desperately. When that power is called upon to verify and support an emotional appraisal, when love is a conscious integration of reason and emotion, of mind and values, then—and only then—it is the greatest reward of man’s life.”"},{"id":1466,"quote":"I win by means of nothing but logic and I surrender to nothing but logic.

Do you ask if it’s ever proper to help another man? No- if he claims it as his right or as a moral duty that you owe him. Yes- if such is your own desire based on your own selfish pleasure in the value of his person and his struggle. Suffering as such is not a value, only man’s fight against suffering is. If you choose to help a man who suffers, do it only on the ground of his virtues, of his fight to recover, of his rational record, or of the fact that he suffers unjustly; then your action is still trade, and his virtue is the payment for your help. But to help a man who has no virtues, to help him on the ground of his suffering as such, to accept his faults, his need, as a claim – is to accept the mortgage of a zero on your values. A man who has no virtues is a hater of existence who acts on the premise of death; to help him is to sanction his evil and to support his career of destruction.

That emotion is: hatred of the good for being the good.This hatred is not resentment against some prescribed view of the good with which one does not agree. . . . Hatred of the good for being the good means hatred of that which one regards as good by one’s own (conscious or subconscious) judgment. It means hatred of a person for possessing a value or virtue one regards as desirable.If a child wants to get good grades in school, but is unable or unwilling to achieve them and begins to hate the children who do, that is hatred of the good. If a man regards intelligence as a value, but is troubled by self-doubt and begins to hate the men he judges to be intelligent, that is hatred of the good.The nature of the particular values a man chooses to hold is not the primary factor in this issue (although irrational values may contribute a great deal to the formation of that emotion). The primary factor and distinguishing characteristic is an emotional mechanism set in reverse: a response of hatred, not toward human vices, but toward human virtues.To be exact, the emotional mechanism is not set in reverse, but is set one way: its exponents do not experience love for evil men; their emotional range is limited to hatred or indifference. It is impossible to experience love, which is a response to values, when one’s automatized response to values is hatred.”"},{"id":1647,"quote":"Man has the power to act as his own destroyer--and that is the way he has acted through most of history. --Atlast Shrugged”"},{"id":1648,"quote":"When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind - and it's roper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression."},{"id":1649,"quote":"Any human being who accepts the help of another, knows that good will is the giver's only motive and that good will is the payment he owes in return."},{"id":1650,"quote":"Get the hell out of my way!\" Said by John Galt as the leaders of the country tried to make him become their dictator."},{"id":1651,"quote":"The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others.

An unread and unreadable book serves this purpose. It does not count on men’s intelligence, but on their weaknesses, pretensions and fears. It is not a tool of enlightenment, but of intellectual intimidation. It is not aimed at the reader’s understanding, but at his inferiority complex.An intelligent man will reject such a book with contemptuous indignation, refusing to waste his time on untangling what he perceives to be gibberish—which is part of the book’s technique: the man able to refute its arguments will not (unless he has the endurance of an elephant and the patience of a martyr). A young man of average intelligence—particularly a student of philosophy or of political science—under a barrage of authoritative pronouncements acclaiming the book as “scholarly, “significant,” “profound,” will take the blame for his failure to understand. More often than not, he will assume that the book’s theory has been scientifically proved and that he alone is unable to grasp it; anxious, above all, to hide his inability, he will profess agreement, and the less his understanding, the louder his agreement—while the rest of the class are going through the same mental process. Most of them will accept the book’s doctrine, reluctantly and uneasily, and lose their intellectual integrity, condemning themselves to a chronic fog of approximation, uncertainty, self doubt. Some will give up the intellect (particularly philosophy) and turn belligerently into “pragmatic,” anti-intellectual Babbitts. A few will see through the game and scramble eagerly for the driver’s seat on the bandwagon, grasping the possibilities of a road to the mentally unearned.Within a few years of the book’s publication, commentators will begin to fill libraries with works analyzing, “clarifying” and interpreting its mysteries. Their notions will spread all over the academic map, ranging from the appeasers, who will try to soften the book’s meaning—to the glamorizers, who will ascribe to it nothing worse than their own pet inanities—to the compromisers, who will try to reconcile its theory with its exact opposite—to the avant-garde, who will spell out and demand the acceptance of its logical consequences. The contradictory, antithetical nature of such interpretations will be ascribed to the book’s profundity—particularly by those who function on the motto: “If I don’t understand it, it’s deep.” The students will believe that the professors know the proof of the book’s theory, the professors will believe that the commentators know it, the commentators will believe that the author knows it—and the author will be alone to know that no proof exists and that none was offered.Within a generation, the number of commentaries will have grown to such proportions that the original book will be accepted as a subject of philosophical specialization, requiring a lifetime of study—and any refutation of the book’s theory will be ignored or rejected, if unaccompanied by a full discussion of the theories of all the commentators, a task which no one will be able to undertake.This is the process by which Kant and Hegel acquired their dominance. Many professors of philosophy today have no idea of what Kant actually said. And no one has ever read Hegel (even though many have looked at every word on his every page).”"},{"id":1758,"quote":"His face was like a law of nature—a thing one could not question, alter or implore.

And when men live by trade—with reason, not force, as their final arbiter—it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability—and the degree of a man’s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money.

Ні - якщо цей інший стверджує, що це його право або ваш моральний обов'язок. Так - якщо таке ваше власне бажання, що спирається на егоїстичну насолоду, що вимірюється цінністю цієї особи. Страждання не є цінністю. Цінністю є тільки той, хто бореться зі стражданням. Якщо ви вирішите допомогти людині, яка страждає, зважайте на його чесноти, на його прагнення відновити сили, на його раціональність або на той факт, що він страждає несправедливо.

Under all the complications of verbiage, haven't they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven't you been able to catch their theme song — 'Give up, give up, give up, give up'? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy — and you've damned it. That's how far we've come. We've tied happiness to guilt. And we've got mankind by the throat. Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace — lie on a bed of nails — go into the desert to mortify the flesh — don't dance — don't go to the movies on Sunday — don't try to get rich — don't smoke — don't drink. It's all the same line. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there's always a purpose in nonsense. Don't bother to examine a folly — ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they'll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don't have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words. 'Universal Harmony' — 'Eternal Spirit' — 'Divine Purpose' — 'Nirvana' — 'Paradise' — 'Racial Supremacy' — 'The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.' Internal corruption, Peter. That's the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice — run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there's service, there's someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it's your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself — that will be the man who's not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you'll scream your empty heads off, howling that he's a selfish monster.

Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion—when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing—when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors—when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you—when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice—you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot. “Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: ‘Account overdrawn.’ “When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, ‘Who is destroying the world?’ You are."},{"id":2375,"quote":"Humanity’s darkest evil, the most destructive horror machine among all the devices of men, is non-objective law.."},{"id":2376,"quote":"Dagny, there’s nothing of any importance in life—except how well you do your work.

Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.“Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort, so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others, but earn it by my own achievement. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others.

Współcześni mistycy mięśni, oferujący wam złudny wybór między „prawami człowieka a „prawem własności”, jakby jedno mogło istnieć bez drugiego, czynią ostatnią groteskową próbę ożywienia doktryny antynomii między duszą a ciałem. Tylko duch może istnieć bez własności materialnej; tylko niewolnik może pracować bez prawa do zatrzymania produktu swoich wysiłków. Doktryna głosząca, że „prawa człowieka” są nadrzędne w stosunku do „prawa własności”, oznacza po prostu, że niektóre jednostki mają prawo się bogacić kosztem innych; skoro kompetentni nie mają nic do zyskania u niekompetentnych, oznacza to prawo niekompetentnych do rozporządzania lepszymi od siebie i używania ich jako krów mlecznych. Każdy, kto uważa to za ludzkie i słuszne, nie ma prawa nosić miana człowieka. Źródłem prawa własności jest zasada przyczyny i skutku. Wszelka własność i wszystkie formy bogactwa są produktem ludzkiego umysłu i pracy. Tak jak nie mogą istnieć skutki pozbawione przyczyn, nie może istnieć bogactwo pozbawione źródła, którym jest inteligencja. Inteligencji nie można zmusić do pracy: ci, którzy potrafią myśleć, nie będą pracować pod przymusem; ci, którzy będą, wyprodukują niewiele więcej niż wart był bicz potrzebny do trzymania ich w ryzach. Produkty umysłu można otrzymywać jedynie na warunkach dyktowanych przez właściciela, w formie wymiany i dzięki dobrowolnej zgodzie. Każda inna polityka ludzi w stosunku do czyjejś własności jest polityką zbrodniarzy, niezależnie od ich liczby. Zbrodniarze to krótkowzroczne dzikusy, głodujące, gdy kończą im się łupy — tak jak dziś głodujecie wy, którzy wierzyliście, że zbrodnia może być „praktyczna”, skoro wasz rząd uznał rabunek za legalny, a opieranie mu się za bezprawne. Jedyną właściwą rolą rządu jest ochrona ludzkich praw, co oznacza ochronę człowieka przed fizyczną przemocą. Właściwy rząd jest policjantem, działającym jako środek samoobrony człowieka i jako taki może używać siły jedynie przeciwko tym, którzy użyli jej pierwsi. Jedynymi właściwymi formacjami rządowymi są: policja, broniąca was przed przestępcami, armia, broniąca was przed obcym agresorem, i sądy, broniące waszej własności i umów przed pogwałceniem lub oszustwem ze strony innych i rozstrzygające dysputy na podstawie racjonalnych zasad, na mocy obiektywnego prawa. Ale rząd inicjujący użycie siły przeciwko ludziom, którzy jej nie użyli, stosowanie zbrojnego przymusu wobec bezbronnych ofiar jest koszmarną, piekielną machiną, mającą na celu unicestwienie moralności: taki rząd odwraca swój jedyny cel moralny i z obrońcy zmienia się w najzacieklejszego wroga człowieka, z policjanta w zbrodniarza obdarzonego prawem używania przemocy wobec ofiar pozbawionych prawa do samoobrony. Taki rząd zastępuje moralność następującą zasadą zachowania społecznego: możesz robić sąsiadowi, co ci się podoba, pod warunkiem, że twój gang jest większy niż jego własny. Tylko cham, głupiec lub tchórz może się zgodzić na istnienie na takich warunkach i podarować innym czek in blanco na swoje życie i umysł, zaakceptować pogląd, że inni mają prawo rozporządzać nim zgodnie ze swoim widzimisię, że wola większości jest wszechmocna, że siła mięśni i liczb może zastąpić sprawiedliwość, rzeczywistość i prawdę. My, ludzie umysłu, będący kupcami, nie zaś panami czy niewolnikami, nie przyjmujemy ani nie wystawiamy czeków in blanco.

You concluded that I was the safest person in the world for you to spit on, precisely because I held you by the throat. You concluded that I wouldn’t want to remind you of it and that I would be tied by the fear of hurting your feelings. All right, let’s get it straight: you’re an object of charity who’s exhausted his credit long ago. Whatever affection I might have felt for you once, is gone. I haven’t the slightest interest in you, your fate or your future. I haven’t any reason whatever for wishing to feed you. If you leave my house, it won’t make any difference to me whether you starve or not. Now that is your position here and I will expect you to remember it, if you wish to stay.

Había logrado escapar, dejando atrás su fortuna, sus fincas, su palacio de mármol y la mujer a la que amaba, y había partido hacia un nuevo mundo. Su primera propiedad en la Argentina fue una cabaña de madera a los pies de los Andes. El sol resplandecía como un faro sobre el escudo de plata de los d’Anconia, clavado sobre la puerta, mientras Sebastián d’Anconia excavaba la tierra en busca de cobre en su primera mina. Pasó varios años, pico en mano, rompiendo rocas desde el amanecer hasta la puesta del sol, con ayuda de unos cuantos aventureros, desertores del ejército español, convictos fugados e indígenas hambrientos. Quince años después de haber salido de España, Sebastián d’Anconia mandó buscar a la mujer que amaba y que lo estaba esperando. Al llegar, ella encontró el escudo de plata sobre la entrada de un palacio de mármol, en medio de un inmenso jardín, y, más lejos, las montañas estriadas por las rojas vetas del metal.
