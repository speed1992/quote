I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons.

In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness."},{"id":449,"quote":"Wisdom cannot be imparted.

A certain streak of genius makes an ominous impression on them, for there exists a deep gulf between genius and the teaching profession. Anyone with a touch of genius seems to his teachers a freak from the very first. As far as teachers are concerned, they define young geniuses as those who are bad, disrespectful, smoke at fourteen, fall in love at fifteen, can be found at sixteen hanging out in bars, read forbidden books, write scandalous essays, occasionally stare down a teacher in class, are marked in the attendance book as rebels, and are budding candidates for room-arrest. A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk. The question of who suffers more acutely at the other's hands - the teacher at the boy's, or vice versa - who is more of a tyrant, more of a tormentor, and who profanes parts of the other's soul, student or teacher, is something you cannot examine without remembering your own youth in anger and shame. yet that s not what concerns us here. We have the consolation that among true geniuses the wounds almost always heal. As their personalities develop, they create their art in spite of school. Once dead, and enveloped by the comfortable nimbus of remoteness, they are paraded by the schoolmasters before other generations of students as showpieces and noble examples. Thus teh struggle between rule and spirit repeats itself year after year from school to school. The authorities go to infinite pains to nip the few profound or more valuable intellects in the bud.

And as I had good eyes and ears and was a little inquisitive too, I took a good look at this so-called life and at my neighbors and acquaintances, fifty or so of them and their destinies, and then I saw you. And I knew that my dreams had been right a thousand times over, just as yours had been. It was life and reality that were wrong. It was as little right that a woman like me should have no other choice than to grow old in poverty and in a senseless way at a typewriter in the pay of a money-maker, or to marry such a man for his money's sake, or to become some kind of drudge, as for a man like you to be forced in his loneliness and despair to have recourse to a razor. Perhaps the trouble with me was more material and moral and with you more spiritual--but it was the same road. Do you think I can't understand your horror of the fox trot, your dislike of bars and dancing floors, your loathing of jazz and the rest of it? I understand it only too well, and your dislike of politics as well, your despondence over the chatter and irresponsible antics of the parties and the press, your despair over the war, the one that has been and the one that is to be, over all that people nowadays think, read and build, over the music they play, the celebrations they hold, the education they carry on. You are right, Steppenwolf, right a thousand times over, and yet you must go to the wall. You are much too exacting and hungry for this simple, easygoing and easily contented world of today. You have a dimension too many. Whoever wants to live and enjoy his life today must not be like you and me. Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours--"},{"id":514,"quote":"-Yo te gusto- continuó ella-, por el motivo que ya te he dicho; he roto tu soledad, te he recogido precisamente ante la puerta del infierno y te he despertado de nuevo.

Why don’t you read it once more and give it the acid test? There’s something about it that doesn’t taste right. I mean the business with the two thieves. The three crosses standing next to each other on the hill are almost impressive, to be sure. But now comes this sentimental little treatise about the good thief. At first he was a thorough scoundrel, had committed all those awful things and God knows what else, and now he dissolves in tears and celebrates such a tearful feast of self-improvement and remorse! What’s the sense of repenting if you’re two steps from the grave? I ask you. Once again, it’s nothing but a priest’s fairy tale, saccharine and dishonest, touched up with sentimentality and given a high edifying background. If you had to pick a friend from between the two thieves or decide which one you’d rather trust, you most certainly wouldn’t choose the sniveling convert. No, the other fellow, he’s a man of character. He doesn’t give a hoot for ‘conversion’, which to a man in his position can’t be anything but a pretty speech. He follows his destiny to it’s appointed end and does not turn coward and forswear the devil, who has aided and abetted him until then. He has character, and people with character tend to receive the short end of the stick in biblical stories. Perhaps he’s even a descendant of Cain. Don’t you agree?\"I was dismayed. Until now I had felt completely at home in the story of the Crucifixion. Now I saw for the first time with how little individuality, with how little power of imagination I had listened to it and read it. Still, Demian’s new concept seemed vaguely sinister and threatened to topple beliefs on whose continued existence I felt I simply had to insist. No, one could not make light of everything, especially not of the most Sacred matters.As usual he noticed my resistance even before I had said anything.\"I know,\" he said in a resigned tone of voice, \"it’s the same old story: don’t take these stories seriously! But I have to tell you something: this is one of the very places that reveals the poverty of this religion most distinctly. The point is that this God of both Old and New Testaments is certainly an extraordinary figure but not what he purports to represent. He is all that is good, noble, fatherly, beautiful, elevated, sentimental—true! But the world consists of something else besides. And what is left over is ascribed to the devil, this entire slice of world, this entire half is hushed up. In exactly the same way they praise God as the father of all life but simply refuse to say a word about our sexual life on which it’s all based, describing it whenever possible as sinful, the work of the devil. I have no objection to worshiping this God Jehovah, far from it. But I mean we ought to consider everything sacred, the entire world, not merely this artificially separated half! Thus alongside the divine service we should also have a service for the devil. I feel that would be right. Otherwise you must create for yourself a God that contains the devil too and in front of which you needn’t close your eyes when the most natural things in the world take place."},{"id":517,"quote":"There are numerous ways in which God can make us lonely and lead us back to ourselves.

A man of the Classical Age who had to live in medieval times would suffocate miserably just as a savage does in the midst of our civilization. Now there are times when a whole generation is caught in this way between two ages, two modes of life, with the consequence that it loses all power to understand itself and has no standard, no security, no simple acquiescence.

When the exalted Gotama spoke in his teachings of the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception and truth, into suffering and salvation. It cannot be done differently, there is no other way for him who wants to teach. But the world itself, what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided. A person or an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful. It does really seem like this, because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real. Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often again.

From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, alreadymultiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life.

It is his duty and responsibility to control the raw energies and desires of his charges and replace them with calmer, more moderate ideals. What would many happy citizens and trustworthy officials have become but unruly, stormy innovators and dreamers of useless dreams, if not for the effort of their schools? In young beings there is something wild, ungovernable, uncultured which first has to be tamed. It is like a dangerous flame that has to be controlled or it will destroy. Natural man is unpredictable, opaque, dangerous, like a torrent cascading out of uncharted mountains. At the start, his soul is a jungle without paths or order. And, like a jungle, it must first be cleared and its growth thwarted.

He saw merchants trading, princes hunting,mourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicianstrying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day forseeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of thiswas not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank,it all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful andbeautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction.

Aquel descubrimiento me conmovió profundamente, este fue el fruto de aquella experiencia. Yo había jugado a menudo con imágenes del futuro y soñado con papeles que pudieran estar destinados de poeta quizás, de profeta, de pintor o de cualquier otra cosa. Aquellas imágenes no valían nada. Yo no estaba en el mundo para escribir, predicar o pintar; ni yo ni nadie estaba para eso. Tales cosas sólo podían surgir marginalmente. La misión verdadera de cada uno era llegar a sí mismo. Se podía llegar a poeta o a loco, a profeta o a criminal; ese no es asunto de uno: a fin de cuentas, carecía de toda importancia. Lo que importaba era encontrar su propio destino, no un destino cualquiera, y vivirlo por completo. Todo lo demás eran medianías, un intento de evasión, de buscar refugio en el ideal de la masa, era amoldarse; era miedo ante la propia individualidad. La nueva imagen surgió terrible y sagrada ante mis ojos, presentido múltiples veces, quizás pronunciada ya otras tantas, pero nunca vivida hasta ahora. Yo era un proyecto de la naturaleza, un proyecto hacia lo desconocido, quizá hacia lo nuevo, quizá hacia la nada; y mi misión, mi única misión, era dejar realizarse este proyecto que brotaba de las profundidades.

Perhaps it was harder, braver and nobler to wander through forests and along the highways with torn shoes, to suffer sun and rain, hunger and need, to play with the joys of the senses and pay for them with suffering. At any rate, Goldmund had shown him that a man destined for high things can dip into the lowest depths of the bloody, drunken chaos of life, and soil himself with much dust and blood, without becoming small and common, without killing the divine spark within himself, that he can err through the thickest darkness without extinguishing the divine light and the creative force inside the shrine of his soul."},{"id":722,"quote":"By degrees, however, he fashioned for himself out of this tendency a philosophy that was actually serviceable to life.

You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world and you tried to suppress the second half the same way the priests and teachers do. You won't succeed.

You will feel the other part, too, you can depend on it. For instance, for about a year you have had to struggle with a drive that is stronger than any other and which is considered 'forbidden.' The Greeks and many other peoples, on the other hand, elevated this drive, made it divine and celebrated it in great feasts. What is forbidden, in other words, is not something eternal; it can change. Anyone can sleep with a woman as soon as he's been to a pastor with her and has married her, yet other races do it differently, even nowadays. That is why each of us has to find out for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden -forbidden for him. It's possible for one never to transgress a single law and still be a bastard. And vice versa. Actually it's only a question of convenience. Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws.

It is the striving after a mean between thecountless extremes and opposites that arise in human conduct. If we take any one of thesecoupled opposites, such as piety and profligacy, the analogy is immediately comprehensible. It isopen to a man to give himself up wholly to spiritual views, to seeking after God, to the ideal of saintliness. On the other hand, he can equally give himself up entirely to the life of instinct, tothe lusts of the flesh, and so direct all his efforts to the attainment of momentary pleasures. Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready toserve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy andcomfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between twoextremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeedsthough it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A mancannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing morehighly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves hisown preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessedby God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to thatdeathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weakimpulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule.

But in this case the attempt to destroy the personality and to break the will did not succeed. He was much too strong and hardy, too proud and spirited. Instead of destroying his personality they succeeded only in teaching him to hate himself. It was against himself that, innocent and noble as he was, he directed during his entire life the whole wealth of his fancy, the whole of his thought; and in so far as he let loose upon himself every barbed criticism, every anger and hate he could command, he was, in spite of all, a real Christian and a real martyr. As for others and the world around him he never ceased in his heroic and earnest endeavour to love them, to be just to them, to do them no harm, for the love of his neighbour was as strongly forced upon him as the hatred of himself, and so his whole life was an example that love of one’s neighbour is not possible without love of oneself, that self-hate is really the same thing as sheer egoism, and in the long run breeds the same cruel isolation and despair."},{"id":798,"quote":"Siddhartha listened.

And everything together, all voices, all goals, all yearning, all suffering, all pleasure, all that was good and evil, all of this together was the world. All of it together was the flow of events, was the music of life. And when Siddhartha was listening attentively to this river, this song of a thousand voices, when he neither listened to the suffering nor the laughter, when he did not tie his soul to any particular voice and submerged his self into it, but when he heard them all, perceived the whole, the oneness, then the great song of the thousand voices consisted of a single word, which was Om: the perfection."},{"id":799,"quote":"Young people have many pleasures and many sorrows, because they have only themselves to think of."},{"id":800,"quote":"وما لبثت أن لاحظت بمضي الزمن أن الغموض في النفس وتدريب الروح ورعايتها، هو ما يعزلني عن الآخرين ويجعلني ثقيلا عليهم غريبا فيهم، ويسلبني القدرة على فهمهم فهما حقيقيا"},{"id":801,"quote":"And so Gotama wandered into the town to obtain alms, and the two Samanas recognized him only by his complete peacefulness of demeanor, by the stillness of his form, in which there was no seeking, no will, no counterfeit, no effort - only light and peace."},{"id":802,"quote":"no matter how close two human beings may be, there is always a gulf between them which only love can bridge, and that only from hour to hour."},{"id":803,"quote":"He had also learned that the sick and unfortunate are far more receptive to traditional magic spells and exorcisms than to sensible advice; that people more readily accept affliction and outward penances than the task of changing themselves, or even examining themselves; that they believe more easily in magic than reason, in formulas than experience . . .

Such instinctive and violent inclinations and disinclinations are signs by which you can recognize the pettier souls. In great souls and superior minds, these passions are not found. Each of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery. Remember this: one can be a strict logician or grammarian, and at the same time full of imagination and music. One can be a musician or Glass Bead Game player and at the same time wholly devoted to rule and order. The kind of person we want to develop, the kind of person we aim to become, would at any time be able to exchange his discipline or art for any other.

His goal attracts him, because he doesn’t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal. This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas.

The grace of a minuet by Handel or Couperin, the sensuality sublimated into delicate gesture to be found in many Italian composers or in Mozart, the tranquil, composed readiness for death in Bach – always there may be heard in these works a defiance, a death-defying intrepidity, a gallantry, and a note of superhuman laughter, of immortal gay serenity.

Only the strongest of them force their way through the atmosphere of the bourgeois earth and attain to the cosmic. The others all resign themselves or make compromises. Despising the bourgeoisie, and yet belonging to it, they add to its strength and glory; for in the last resort they have to share their beliefs in order to live. The lives of these infinitely numerous persons make no claim to the tragic; but they live under an evil star in a quite considerable affliction; and in this hell their talents ripen and bear fruit. The few who break free seek their reward in the unconditioned and go down in splendor. They wear the thorn crown and their number is small. The others, however, who remain in the fold and from whose talents the bourgeoisie reaps much gain, have a third kingdom left open to them, an imaginary and yet a sovereign world, humor. The lone wolves who know no peace, these victims of unceasing pain to whom the urge for tragedy has been denied and who can never break through the starry space,who feel themselves summoned thither and yet cannot survive in its atmosphere—for them is reserved, provided suffering has made their spirits tough and elastic enough, a way of reconcilement and an escape into humor. Humor has always something bourgeois in it, although the true bourgeois is incapable of understanding it. In its imaginary realm the intricate and manyfaceted ideal of all Steppenwolves finds its realisation. Here it is possible not only to extol the saint and the profligate in one breath and to make the poles meet, but to include the bourgeois, too, in the same affirmation. Now it is possible to be possessed by God and to affirm the sinner, and vice versa, but it is not possible for either saint or sinner (or for any other of the unconditioned) to affirm as well that lukewarm mean, the bourgeois. Humor alone, that magnificent discovery of those who are cut short in their calling to highest endeavor, those who falling short of tragedy are yet as rich in gifts as in affliction, humor alone (perhaps the most inborn and brilliant achievement of the spirit) attains to the impossible and brings every aspect of human existence within the rays of its prism. To live in the world as though it were not the world, to respect the law and yet to stand above it, to have possessions as though \"one possessed nothing,\" to renounce as though it were no renunciation, all these favorite and often formulated propositions of an exalted worldly wisdom, it is in the power of humor alone to make efficacious."},{"id":1266,"quote":"Every phenomenon on earth is a parable and every parable is an open gate (...)"},{"id":1267,"quote":"To stiffen into stone, to persevere!We long forever for the right to stay.But all that stays with us is fear,And we shall never rest upon our way."},{"id":1268,"quote":"بيد أن ما أسعى إليه ليس تغييرَ ذاتي ، فوحدها المعجزة تملك ذلك .. وكل من ينشد معجزة ، كل من يتعلّق بها ويحاول بلوغها فسيشهد تلاشيها أمام ناظريه .. !إن ما أسعى إليه هو أن أقبَضَ في التأرجح الدائم بين عنف المتضادات .. وأن أكون على أهبة الاستعداد حين تباغتني المعجزة ..!إن مطمحي هو أن أبقى بغير ما رضا ، وأن أملك القدرة على تحمل كل هذا القلق .."},{"id":1269,"quote":"Damit das Mögliche entsteht, muß immer wieder das Unmögliche versucht werden."},{"id":1270,"quote":"Veo que piensas más de lo que puedes expresar.

Since I had taken the liberty of discontinuing my regular meditation exercises, he pointed out, I should at least have realized what was wrong as soon as the first evil consequences appeared, and should have resumed meditation. He was perfectly right. I had omitted meditating for quite a while on the grounds that I had no time, was too distracted or out of spirits, or too busy and excited with my studies. Moreover, as time went on I had completely lost all awareness of my continuous sin of omission. Even now, when I was desperate and had almost run aground, it had taken an outsider to remind me of it. As a matter of fact, I was to have the greatest difficulty snapping out of this state of neglect. I had to return to the training routines and beginners’ exercises in meditation in order gradually to relearn the art of composing myself and sinking into contemplation.

But the fact is, Joseph, that the more we demand of ourselves, or the more our task at any given time demands of us, the more dependant we are on meditation as a wellspring of energy, as the ever-renewing concord of mind and soul. And – I could if I wished give you quite a few more examples of this – the more intensively a task requires our energies, arousing and exalting us at one time, tiring and depressing us at another, the more easily we may come to neglect this wellspring, just as when we are carried away by some intellectual work we easily forget to attend to the body. The really great men in the history of the world have all either known how to meditate or have unconsciously found their way to the place to which meditation leads us. Even the most vigorous and gifted among the others all failed and were defeated in the end because their task or their ambitious dream seized hold of them, made them into persons so possessed that they lost the capacity for liberating themselves from present things, and attaining perspective.

And when Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to this thousand-voiced song, when he listened neither for the sorrow nor for the laughter, when he did not attach his soul to any one voice and enter into it with his ego but rather heard all of them, heard the whole, the oneness—then the great song of the thousand voices consisted only of a single word: Om, perfection."},{"id":1397,"quote":"If a transaction in progress appeared threatened with failure, if a shipment of goods seemed to have gone astray, or if a debtor appeared unable to repay his debt, Kamaswami was never able to persuade Siddhartha that it was useful to speak words of worry or of anger, to have a wrinkled brow, or to sleep poorly."},{"id":1398,"quote":"But living alone forever and ever, among the quietly sleeping tree trunks, with animals that ran away, with whom one could not speak—that would be unbearably sad."},{"id":1399,"quote":"And all this, I said, just as today was the case with the beginnings of wireless, would be of no more service to man than as an escape from himself and his true aims, and a means of surrounding himself with an ever closer mesh of distractions and useless activities."},{"id":1400,"quote":"لست انت المؤهل للتفكيرفيما إذا كان الله ينصت إلى صلواتك، أو إن كان موجودا حقا كما تتخيله أنت. وليس من شأنك أن تغتاظ أو تنتابك الحيرة حول ما إذا كانت كل صراعاتنا الإنسانية ما هي إلى لعب أطفال. يجب أن تحرم على نفسك تحريما تاما تقليب كل تلك الإفكار الصبيانية الحمقاء أثناء تدربك. اتل الصلاة الربانية وترتيلك وكرس نفسك للكلمات امتلىء بها دعها تنفذ فيك وكأنك تغني أو تعزف القيثارة فحين تغني أو تعزف لا تدع عقلك يشرد ليتصيد أفكارا وتأملات حاذقة. إنما أنت تكافح لإخراج كل نغمة تنقرها بأقصى ما بطاقتك في وضوح وكمال. وعنجما نغني لا نعيق أنفاسنا بتساؤلنا عن جدوى الغناء، إننا نغني، لا أكثر! وهكذا يجب أن نصلي"},{"id":1401,"quote":"Nos sentimos tentados a creerlos caprichos nuestros, creaciones propias, vemos vacilar y disolverse la frontera entre nosotros y la naturaleza, y adquirimos conciencia de un estado de ánimo en el que no sabemos si las imágenes en nuestra retina provienen de impresiones exteriores o interiores.

Una misma divinidad invisible actúa en nosotros y en la naturaleza, y si el mundo exterior desapareciera, cualquiera de nosotros sería capaz de reconstruirlo, porque los montes y los ríos, los árboles y las hojas, las raíces y las flores, todo lo creado en la naturaleza, está ya prefigurado en nosotros: proviene del alma, cuya esencia es eterna, y escapa a nuestro conocimiento, pero que se nos hace patente como fuerza amorosa y creadora."},{"id":1402,"quote":"— Nie, to nie żarty. Opowiadam ci tylko, do czego doszedłem. Można przekazywać wiedzę, ale nie mądrość. Mądrość można znaleźć, można nią żyć, można się na niej wspierać, można dzięki niej czynić cuda, ale wypowiedzieć jej i nauczać nie sposób. Domyślałem się tego już jako chłopak i to właśnie odsunęło mnie od nauczycieli. Dokonałem pewnego odkrycia, Gowindo, które ty znowu uznasz za żart albo za błazeństwo, ale to najbardziej cenna z moich myśli. Oto przeciwieństwo każdej prawdy jest równie prawdziwe! Prawdę można przecież wypowiedzieć i ubrać w słowa tylko wtedy, gdy jest to prawda jednostronna. Wszystko, co ma postać myśli i daje się wyrazić słowami, jest jednostronne, jest połowiczne, brakuje mu całości, dopełnienia, jedności. Gdy wzniosły Gautama nauczał o świecie, musiał go podzielić na sansarę i nirwanę, na złudzenie i prawdę, na ból i wyzwolenie. Inaczej się nie da, kto chce nauczać, nie ma przed sobą innej drogi. Ale sam świat, to, co jest wokół nas i w nas w środku nigdy nie jest jednostronne. Żaden człowiek ani żaden uczynek nie należy całkowicie do sansary ani do nirwany, żaden człowiek nie jest do końca grzeszny ani święty. Tak się wydaje, owszem, ponieważ ulegamy złudzeniu, iż czas jest czymś rzeczywistym. Czas nie jest czymś rzeczywistym. A jeśli czas nie jest rzeczywisty, to i ta odległość, jaka zdaje się dzielić świat od wieczności, cierpienie od szczęścia, zło od dobra, jest tylko złudzeniem. — Jakże to? — spytał niespokojnie Gowinda. — Posłuchaj mnie, mój miły, słuchaj mnie dobrze! Grzesznik, taki jak ja i taki jak ty, jest grzesznikiem, ale kiedyś znowu złączy się z brahmanem, osiągnie kiedyś nirwanę, będzie buddą i teraz zobacz: to “kiedyś\" jest złudzeniem, jest tylko przenośnią! Naprawdę bowiem nie jest tak, że grzesznik przebywa jakąś drogę, by stać się buddą, nie staje się nim w trakcie rozwoju, choć nasz umysł nie potrafi sobie tego inaczej wyobrazić. Nie, w grzeszniku jest już teraz dzisiaj przyszły buddą, cała jego przyszłość już w nim jest zawarta i w tym grzeszniku, w sobie samym, w każdym człowieku należy wielbić przyszłego, możliwego, ukrytego buddę. Świat, przyjacielu, nie jest doskonały ani też nie zbliża się powoli do doskonałości, nie: jest doskonały w każdej chwili, wszelki grzech zawiera w sobie już łaskę, każde dziecko nosi w sobie starca, każdy noworodek śmierć, każdy umierający wieczne życie. Nikomu z ludzi nie jest dane ocenić, jak daleko inny zaszedł na swej drodze, w zbóju i hulace czeka już budda, w braminie czeka zbój. Głęboka medytacja pozwala ci znieść czas, widzieć naraz wszelkie życie niegdysiejsze, obecne i przyszłe, i wtedy wszystko jest doskonałe, wszystko jest brahmanem. Dlatego wszystko, co jest, zdaje mi się dobre, śmierć na równi z życiem, grzech na równi ze świętością, roztropność na równi z głupotą, wszystko musi być takie, jakie jest, potrzeba tylko mojej zgody, mojej dobrej woli, mojego przyzwolenia, a wszystko jest dla mnie dobre, może mnie tylko wesprzeć, nie może mi szkodzić. Na własnym ciele i duszy doświadczyłem, że potrzeba mi było grzechów, potrzebna mi była rozpusta, chciwość, próżność i najstraszniejsze zwątpienie, aby nauczyć się uległości, aby pokochać świat, aby nie porównywać go z jakimś przez siebie wymarzonym, wyobrażonym światem, z wymyślonym jakimś rodzajem doskonałości, tylko zostawić go takim, jakim jest, i kochać go i cieszyć się, że do niego należę.

And here it must be said that to call suicides only those who actually destroy themselves is false. Among these, indeed, there are many who in a sense are suicides only by accident and in whose being suicide has no necessary place. Among the common run of men there are many of little personality and stamped with no deep impress of fate, who find their end in suicide without belonging on that account to the type of the suicide by inclination; while on the other hand, of those who are to be counted as suicides by the very nature of their beings are many, perhaps a majority, who never in fact lay hands on themselves. The \"suicide,\" and Harry was one, need not necessarily live in a peculiarly close relationship to death. One may do this without being a suicide. What is peculiar to the suicide is that his ego, rightly or wrongly, is felt to be an extremely dangerous, dubious, and doomed germ of nature; that he is always in his own eyes exposed to an extraordinary risk, as though he stood with the slightest foothold on the peak of a crag whence a slight push from without or an instant's weakness from within suffices to precipitate him into the void. The line of fate in the case of these men is marked by the belief they have that suicide is their most probable manner of death. It might be presumed that such temperaments, which usually manifest themselves in early youth and persist through life, show a singular defect of vital force. On the contrary, among the \"suicides\" are to be found unusually tenacious and eager and also hardy natures."},{"id":1509,"quote":"My advice to the person suffering from lack of time and from apathy is this: Seek out each day as many as possible of the small joys, and thriftily save up the larger, more demanding pleasures for holidays and appropriate hours.

En todas las paredes anuncios fieros y magníficamente llamativos invitaban a toda la nación, en letras gigantescas que ardían como antorchas, a ponerse al fin al lado de los hombres contra las máquinas, a asesinar por fin a los ricos opulentos, bien vestidos y perfumados, que con ayuda de las máquinas sacaban el jugo a los demás y hacer polvo a la vez sus grandes automóviles, que no cesaban de toser, de gruñir con mala intención y de hacer un ruido infernal, a incendiar por último las fábricas y barrer y despoblar un poco la tierra profanada, para que pudiera volver a salir la hierba y surgir otra vez del polvoriento mundo de cemento algo así como bosques, praderas, pastos, arroyos y marismas.

It is the striving after a mean between thecountless extremes and opposites that arise in human conduct. If we take any one of thesecoupled opposites, such as piety and profligacy, the analogy is immediately comprehensible. It isopen to a man to give himself up wholly to spiritual views, to seeking after God, to the ideal of saintliness. On the other hand, he can equally give himself up entirely to the life of instinct, tothe lusts of the flesh, and so direct all his efforts to the attainment of momentary pleasures. Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready to serve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy and comfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between two extremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeeds though it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A man cannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing more highly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves his own preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessed by God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to that deathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weak impulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule.

He has discovered that the one-fold of the body is not inhabited by a one-fold of the soul, and that at best he is only at the beginning of a long pilgrimage towards this ideal harmony. He would like either to overcome the wolf and become wholly man or to renounce mankind and at last to live wholly a wolf's life. It may be presumed that he has never carefully watched a real wolf. Had he done so he would have seen, perhaps, that even animals are not undivided in spirit. With them, too, the well-knit beauty of the body hides a being of manifold states and strivings. The wolf, too, has his abysses. The wolf, too, suffers. No, back to nature is a false track that leads nowhere but to suffering and despair. Harry can never turn back again and become wholly wolf, and could he do so he would find that even the wolf is not of primeval simplicity, but already a creature of manifold complexity. Even the wolf has two, and more than two, souls in his wolf's breast, and he who desires to be a wolf falls into the same forgetfulness as the man who sings: \"If I could be a child once more!\" He who sentimentally sings of blessed childhood is thinking of the return to nature and innocence and the origin of things, and has quite forgotten that these blessed children are beset with conflict and complexities and capable of all suffering. There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, already multiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source. The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back, not back to the wolf or to the child, but ever further into sin, ever deeper into human life. Nor will suicide really solve your problem, unhappy Steppenwolf. You will, instead, embark on the longer and wearier and harder road of life. You will have to multiply many times your two-fold being and complicate your complexities still further. Instead of narrowing your world and simplifying your soul, you will have to absorb more and more of the world and at last take all of it up in your painfully expanded soul, if you are ever to find peace. This is the road that Buddha and every great man has gone, whether consciously or not, insofar as fortune favored his quest. All births mean separation from the All, the confinement within limitation, the separation from God, the pangs of being born ever anew. The return into the All, the dissolution of painful individuation, the reunion with God means the expansion of the soul until it is able once more to embrace the All."},{"id":1735,"quote":"Without a mother you cannot die."},{"id":1736,"quote":"Un veggente e un cieco: così camminavano a fianco; e se il cieco ignorava la sua cecità, il sollievo era solo suo."},{"id":1737,"quote":"Let me return from history and draw my conclusion. What all this means to us at the present time is this: Our system has already passed its flowering. Some time ago it reached that summit of blessedness which the mysterious game of world history sometimes allows to things beautiful and desirable in themselves. We are on the downward slope. Our course may possible stretch out for a very long time, but in any case nothing finer, ore beautiful, and more desirable than what we have already had can henceforth be expected. The road leads downhill. Historically we are, I believe, ripe for dismantling. And there is no doubt that such will be our fate, not today or tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow. I do not draw this conclusion from any excessively moralistic estimate of our accomplishments and our abilities: I draw it far more from the movements which I see already on the way in the outside world. Critical times are approaching; the omens can be sensed everywhere; the world is once again about to shift its center of gravity. Displacements of power are in the offing. They will not take place without war and violence. From the Far East comes a threat not only to peace, but to life and liberty. Even if our country remains politically neutral, even if our whole nation unanimously abides by tradition (which is not the case) and attempts to remain faithful to Castalian ideals, that will be in vain. Some of our representatives in Parliament are already saying that Castalia is a rather expensive luxury for our country. The country may very soon be forced into a serious rearmament - armaments for defensive purposes only, of course - and great economies will be necessary. In spite of the government's benevolent disposition towards us, much of the economizing will strike us directly. We are proud that our Order and the cultural continuity it provides have cost the country as little as they have. In comparison with other ages, especially the early period of the Feuilletonistic Age with its lavishly endowed universities, its innumerable consultants and opulent institutes, this toll is really not large. It is infinitesimal compared with the sums consumed for war and armaments during the Century of Wars. But before too long this kind of armament may once again be the supreme necessity; the generals will again dominate Parliament; and if the people are confronted with the choice of sacrificing Castalia or exposing themselves to the danger of war and destruction, we know how they will choose. Undoubtedly a bellicose ideology will burgeon. The rash of propaganda will affect youth in particular. Then scholars and scholarship, Latin and mathematics, education and culture, will be considered worth their salt only to the extent that they can serve the ends of war."},{"id":1738,"quote":"Bilmeyecek ne var!

They reported on, or rather \"chatted\" about, a thousand-and-one items of knowledge. The cleverer writers poked fun at their own work. Many such pieces are so incomprehensible that they can only be viewed as self-persiflage on the part of the authors.In some periods interviews with well-known personalities on current problems were particularly popular. Noted chemists or piano virtuosos would be queried about politics, for example, or popular actors, dancers, gymnasts, aviators, or even poets would be drawn out on the benefits and drawbacks of being a bachelor, or on the presumptive causes of financial crises, and so on.All that mattered in these pieces was to link a well-known name with a subject of current topical interest.It is very hard indeed for us to put ourselves in the place of those people so that we can truly understand them. But the great majority, who seem to have been strikingly fond of reading, must have accepted all these grotesque things with credulous earnestness.If a famous painting changed owners, if a precious manuscript was sold at auction, if an old palace burned down, the readers of many thousands of feature articles at once learned the facts. What is more, on that same day or by the next day at the latest they received an additional dose of anecdotal, historical, psychological, erotic, and other stuff on the catchword of the moment.A torrent of zealous scribbling poured out over every ephemeral incident, and in quality, assortment, and phraseology all this material bore the mark of mass goods rapidly and irresponsibly turned out.Incidentally, there appear to have been certain games which were regular concomitants of the feature article. The readers themselves took the active role in these games, which put to use some of their glut of information fodder.Thousands upon thousands spent their leisure hours sitting over squares and crosses made of letters of the alphabet, filling in the gaps according to certain rules.But let us be wary of seeing only the absurd or insane aspect of this, and let us abstain from ridiculing it. For these people with their childish puzzle games and their cultural feature articles were by no means innocuous children or playful Phaeacians.Rather, they dwelt anxiously among political, economic, and moral ferments and earthquakes, waged a number of frightful wars and civil wars, and their little cultural games were not just charming, meaningless childishness.These games sprang from their deep need to close their eyes and flee from unsolved problems and anxious forebodings of doom into an imaginary world as innocuous as possible.They assiduously learned to drive automobiles, to play difficult card games and lose themselves in crossword puzzles--for they faced death, fear, pain, and hunger almost without defenses, could no longer accept the consolations of the churches, and could obtain no useful advice from Reason.These people who read so many articles and listened to so many lectures did not take the time and trouble to strengthen themselves against fear, to combat the dread of death within themselves; they moved spasmodically on through life and had no belief in a tomorrow."},{"id":1843,"quote":"Here it is Saturday.

Theone path leads to the saint, to the martyrdom of the spirit and surrender to God. The other pathleads to the profligate, to the martyrdom of the flesh, the surrender to corruption. Now it isbetween the two, in the middle of the road, that the bourgeois seeks to walk. He will neversurrender himself either to lust or to asceticism. He will never be a martyr or agree to his owndestruction. On the contrary, his ideal is not to give up but to maintain his own identity. Hestrives neither for the saintly nor its opposite. The absolute is his abhorrence. He may be ready toserve God, but not by giving up the fleshpots. He is ready to be virtuous, but likes to be easy andcomfortable in this world as well. In short, his aim is to make a home for himself between twoextremes in a temperate zone without violent storms and tempests; and in this he succeedsthough it be at the cost of that intensity of life and feeling which an extreme life affords. A mancannot live intensely except at the cost of the self. Now the bourgeois treasures nothing morehighly than the self (rudimentary as his may be). And so at the cost of intensity he achieves hisown preservation and security. His harvest is a quiet mind which he prefers to being possessedby God, as he does comfort to pleasure, convenience to liberty, and a pleasant temperature to thatdeathly inner consuming fire. The bourgeois is consequently by nature a creature of weakimpulses, anxious, fearful of giving himself away and easy to rule. Therefore, he has substitutedmajority for power, law for force, and the polling booth for responsibility."},{"id":1884,"quote":"Patria non è qua o là.

The strict scholars and scientists despise it—and so do some musicians also—because, they say, it lacks that degree of strictness which their specialties can achieve. Well and good, you will encounter these antinomies, and in time you will discover that they are subjective, not objective—that, for example, a fancy-free artist avoids pure mathematics or logic not because he understands them and could say something about them if he wished, but because he instinctively inclines toward other things. Such instinctive and violent inclinations and disinclinations are signs by which you can recognize the pettier souls. In great souls and superior minds, these passions are not found. Each of us is merely one human being, merely an experiment, a way station. But each of us should be on the way toward perfection, should be striving to reach the center, not the periphery. Remember this: one can be a strict logician or grammarian, and at the same time full of imagination and music. One can be a musician or Glass Bead Game player and at the same time wholly devoted to rule and order.

Ed egli trovò: « L'Io era, ciò di cui volevo apprendere il senso e l'essenza. L'Io era, ciò di cui volevo liberarmi, ciò che volevo superare. Ma non potevo superarlo, potevo soltanto ingannarlo, potevo soltanto fuggire o nascondermi davanti a lui. In verità, nessuna cosa al mondo ha tanto occupato i miei pensieri come questo mio Io, questo enigma ch'io vivo, d'essere uno, distinto e separato da tutti gli altri, d'essere Siddharta! E su nessuna cosa al mondo so tanto poco quanto su di me, Siddharta!».Colpito da questo pensiero s'arrestò improvvisamente nel suo lento cammino meditativo, e tosto da questo pensiero ne balzò fuori un altro, che suonava: « Che io non sappia nulla di me, che Siddharta mi sia rimasto così estraneo e sconosciuto, questo dipende da una causa fondamentale, una sola: io avevo paura di me, prendevo la fuga davanti a me stesso! L'Atman cercavo, Brahma cercavo, e volevo smembrare e scortecciare il mio Io, per trovare nella sua sconosciuta profondità il nocciolo di tutte le cortecce, l'Atman, la vita, il divino, l'assoluto. Ma proprio io, intanto, andavo perduto a me stesso ».Siddharta schiuse gli occhi e si guardò intorno, un sorriso gli illuminò il volto, e un profondo sentimento, come di risveglio da lunghi sogni, lo percorse fino alla punta dei piedi. E appena si rimise in cammino, correva in fretta, come un uomo che sa quel che ha da fare.« Oh! » pensava respirando profondamente « ora Siddharta non me lo voglio più lasciar scappare! Basta! cominciare il pensiero e la mia vita con l'Atman e col dolore del mondo! Basta! uccidermi e smembrarmi, per scoprire un segreto dietro le rovine! Non sarà più lo Yoga-Veda a istruirmi, né l'Atharva-Veda, né gli asceti, né alcuna dottrina. Dal mio stesso Io voglio andare a scuola, voglio conoscermi, voglio svelare quel mistero che ha nome Siddharta ».Si guardò attorno come se vedesse per la prima volta il mondo. Bello era il mondo, variopinto, raro e misterioso era il mondo! Qui era azzurro, là giallo, più oltre verde, il cielo pareva fluire lentamente come i fiumi, immobili stavano il bosco e la montagna, tutto bello, tutto enigmatico e magico, e in mezzo v'era lui, Siddharta, il risvegliato, sulla strada che conduce a se stesso. Tutto ciò, tutto questo giallo e azzurro, fiume e bosco penetrava per la prima volta attraverso la vista in Siddharta, non era più l'incantesimo di Mara, non era più il velo di Maya, non era più insensata e accidentale molteplicità del mondo delle apparenze, spregevole agli occhi del Brahmino, che, tutto dedito ai suoi profondi pensieri, scarta la molteplicità e solo dell'unità va in cerca. L'azzurro era azzurro, il fiume era fiume, e anche se nell'azzurro e nel fiume vivevan nascosti come in Siddharta l'uno e il divino, tale era appunto la natura e il senso del divino, d'esser qui giallo, là azzurro, là cielo, là bosco e qui Siddharta. Il senso e l'essenza delle cose erano non in qualche cosa oltre e dietro loro, ma nelle cose stesse, in tutto.« Come sono stato sordo e ottuso! » pensava, e camminava intanto rapidamente. «Quand'uno legge uno scritto di cui vuoi conoscere il senso, non ne disprezza i segni e le lettere, né li chiama illusione, accidente e corteccia senza valore, bensì li decifra, li studia e li ama, lettera per lettera. Io invece, io che volevo leggere il libro del mondo e il libro del mio proprio Io, ho disprezzato i segni e le lettere, a favore d'un significato congetturato in precedenza, ho chiamato illusione il mondo delle apparenze, ho chiamato il mio occhio e la mia lingua fenomeni accidentali e senza valore.

Di notte vedeva ordinarsi in cielo le stelle, e la falce della luna galleggiare come una nave nell'azzurro. Vedeva alberi, stelle, animali, nuvole, arcobaleni, rocce, erbe, fiori, ruscelli e fiumi; vedeva la rugiada luccicare nei cespugli al mattino, alti monti azzurri e diafani nella lontananza; gli uccelli cantavano e le api ronzavano, il vento vibrava argentino nelle risaie. Tutto questo era sempre esistito nei suoi mille aspetti variopinti, sempre erano sorti il sole e la luna, sempre avevano scrosciato i torrenti e ronzato le api, ma nel passato tutto ciò non era stato per Siddharta che un velo effimero e menzognero calato davanti ai suoi occhi, considerato con diffidenza e destinato a essere trapassato e dissolto dal pensiero, poiché non era realtà: la realtà era al di là delle cose visibili. Ma ora il suo occhio liberato s'indugiava al di qua, vedeva e riconosceva le cose visibili, cercava la sua patria in questo mondo, non cercava la \" Realtà \", né aspirava ad alcun al di là. Bello era il mondo a considerarlo così: senza indagine, così semplicemente, in una disposizione di spirito infantile. Belli la luna e gli astri, belli il ruscello e le sue sponde, il bosco e la roccia, la capra e il maggiolino, fiori e farfalle. Bello e piacevole andar così per il mondo e sentirsi cosi bambino, così risvegliato, così aperto all'immediatezza delle cose, così fiducioso. Diverso era ora l'ardore del sole sulla pelle, diversamente fredda l'acqua dei ruscelli e dei pozzi, altro le zucche e le banane. Brevi erano i giorni, brevi le notti, ogni ora volava via rapida come vela sul mare, e sotto la vela una barca carica di tesori, piena di gioia. Siddharta vedeva un popolo di scimmie agitarsi su tra i rami nell'alta volta del bosco e ne udiva lo strepito selvaggio e ingordo. Siddharta vedeva un montone inseguire una pecora e congiungersi con lei. Tra le canne di una palude vedeva il luccio cacciare affannato verso sera: davanti a lui i pesciolini sciamavano a frotte rapidamente, guizzando e balenando fuor d'acqua impauriti; un'incalzante e appassionata energia si sprigionava dai cerchi precipitosi che l'impetuoso cacciatore tracciava nell'acqua.

Bunun tersine, kendini tümüyle içgüdüsel yaşama, duygularının isteklerine teslim edip çabasını anlık bazların kazanımına yöneltme olanağıyla da donatılmıştır. Birinci yol ermişliğe, manevi şehitliğe, Tanrı uğruna kendini feda etmeye; ikinci yol ise zevkperestliğe, içgüdüler uğruna canını vermeye, çürüyüp kokuşmalar uğruna kendini gözden çıkarmaya gö­türür kişiyi. îşte orta sınıf insanı bu ikisi arasındaki ılıman iklimdeyaşamaya çalışır.

Hayatı yoğun olarak yaşayabilmenin tek yolu, faturayı ben'e ödetmektir. Orta sınıftan biri için kendi ben'inden, kuş­kusuz yeterince gelişmeyip güdük kalmış bu ben'den değerli bir şeyyoktur.

Ragazzo, non ho avuto a che fare se non con dei e sacrifici. Giovane, non ho avuto a che fare se non con ascesi, meditazione e contemplazione, sempre in cerca di Brahma, sempre intento a venerare l'eterno nello Atman. Ma quando fui giovanotto mi riunii ai penitenti, vissi nella foresta, soffersi il caldo e il gelo, appresi a sopportare la fame, appresi a far morire il mio corpo. Meravigliosa mi giunse allora la rivelazione attraverso la dottrina del grande Buddha, e sentii la conoscenza dell'unità del mondo circolare in me come il mio stesso sangue. Ma anche da Buddha e dalla grande conoscenza mi dovetti staccare. Me n'andai, e appresi da Kamala la gioia d'amore, appresi da Kamaswami il commercio, accumulai denaro, dissipai denaro, appresi ad amare il mio stomaco, a lusingare i miei sensi. Molti anni dovetti impiegare per perdere lo spirito, disapprendere il pensiero, dimenticare l'unità. Non è forse come se lentamente e per grandi traviamenti io mi fossi rifatto, d'uomo, bambino, di saggio che ero, un uomo puerile? Eppure è stata buona questa via, e l'usignolo non è ancor morto nel mio petto. Ma che via fu questa! Son dovuto passare attraverso tanta sciocchezza, tanta bruttura, tanto errore, tanto disgusto e delusione e dolore, solo per ridiventare bambino e poter ricominciare da capo. Ma è stato giusto, il mio cuore lo approva, gli occhi miei ne ridono. Ho dovuto provare la disperazione, ho dovuto abbassarmi fino al più stolto di tutti i pensieri, al pensiero del suicidio, per poter rivivere la grazia, per riapprendere l'Om, per poter di nuovo dormire tranquillo e risvegliarmi sereno. Ho dovuto essere un pazzo, per sentire di nuovo l'Atman. Ho dovuto peccare per poter rivivere. Dove può ancora condurmi il mio cammino?

The greatest of his vices was a persistent neglect of meditation, which he refused to take seriously. The purpose of meditation, after all, is adaptation of the individual to the hierarchy, and application in it might very well have cured him of his neurasthenia. For it infallibly helped him whenever, after a period of bad conduct, excessive excitement, or melancholia, his superiors disciplined him by prescribing strict meditation exercises under supervision. Even Knecht, kindly disposed and forgiving though he was, frequently had to resort to this measure.  There was no question about it: Tegularius was a willful, moody person who refused to fit into his society. Every so often he would display the liveliness of his intellect. When highly stimulated he could be entrancing; his mordant wit sparkled and he overwhelmed everyone with the audacity and richness of his sometimes somber inspirations. But basically he was incurable, for he did not want to be cured; he cared nothing for co-ordination and a place in the scheme of things. He loved nothing but his freedom, his perpetual student status, and preferred spending his whole life as the unpredictable and obstinate loner, the gifted fool and nihilist, to following the path of subordination to the hierarchy and thus attaining peace. He cared nothing for peace, had no regard for the hierarchy, hardly minded reproof and isolation. Certainly he was a most inconvenient and indigestible component in a community whose idea was harmony and orderliness. But because of this very troublesomeness and indigestiblity he was, in the midst of such a limpid and prearranged little world, a constant source of vital unrest, a reproach, an admonition and warning, a spur to new, bold, forbidden, intrepid ideas, an unruly, stubborn sheep in the herd.

Each age will take certain kinds of suffering for granted, will patiently accept certain wrongs. Human life becomes a real hell of suffering only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. Required to live in the Middle Ages, someone from the Graeco-Roman period would have died a wretched death by suffocation, just as a savage inevitably would in the midst our civilisation. Now, there are times when a whole generation gets caught to such an extent between two eras, two styles of life, that nothing comes naturally to it since it has lost all sense of morality, security and innocence.

Such was the case with the peace Josephus Famulus enjoyed. It was unstable, visible one moment, gone the next, sometimes near as a candle carried in the hand, sometimes as remote as a star in the wintry sky. And in time a new and special kind of sin and temptation more and more often made life difficult for him. It was not a strong, passionate emotion such as indignation or a sudden rush of instinctual urges. Rather, it seemed to be the opposite. It was a feeling very easy to bear in its initial stages, for it was scarcely perceptible; a condition without any real pain or deprivation, a slack, luke-warm, tedious state of the soul which could only be described in negative terms as a vanishing, a waning, and finally a complete absence of joy. There are days when the sun does not shine and the rain does not pour, but the sky sinks quietly into itself, wraps itself up, is gray but not black, sultry, but not with the tension of an imminent thunderstorm. Gradually, Joseph's days became like this as he approached old age. Less and less could he distinguish the mornings from the evenings, feast days from ordinary days, hours of rapture from hours of dejection. Everything ran sluggishly long in limp tedium and joylessness. This is old age, he thought sadly. He was sad because he had expected aging and the gradual extinction of his passions to bring a brightening and easing of his life, to take him a step nearer to harmony and mature peace of soul, and now age seemed to be disappointing and cheating him by offering nothing but this weary, gray, joyless emptiness, this feeling of chronic satiation. Above all he felt sated: by sheer existence, by breathing, by sleep at night, by life in his cave on the edge of the little oasis, by the eternal round of evenings and mornings, by the passing of travelers and pilgrims, camel riders and donkey riders, and most of all by the people who came to visit him, by those foolish, anxious, and childishly credulous people who had this craving to tell him about their lives, their sins and their fears, their temptations and self-accusations. Sometimes it all seemed to him like the small spring of water that collected in its stone basin in the oasis, flowed through grass for a while, forming a small brook, and then flowed on out into the desert sands, where after a brief course it dried up and vanished. Similarly, all these confessions, these inventories of sins, these lives, these torments of conscience, big and small, serious and vain, all of them came pouring into his ear, by the dozens, by the hundreds, more and more of them. But his ear was not dead like the desert sands. His ear was alive and could not drink, swallow, and absorb forever. It felt fatigued, abused, glutted. It longed for the flow and splashing of words, confessions, anxieties, charges, self-condemnations to cease; it longed for peace, death, and stillness to take the place of this endless flow."},{"id":2896,"quote":"Without words, without wrting and without books there would be no history, there could be no concept of humanity."},{"id":2897,"quote":"Čia reikia pridurti, jog klaidinga vadinti savižudžiais tik tuos žmones, kurie iš tikrųjų nusižudo.

Ez volt az, amit már fiatalember koromban is sejtettem néha, ez a sejtés hajtott tovább, hogy elhagyjam mestereimet.

Nem bizony, hanem a bűnösben benne van, már itt és most benne van az eljövendő Buddha, jelen van benne egész jövendője, és benne, magadban és minden keletkezőben a lehetséges, a rejtőzködő Buddhát kell tisztelned. A világ, Govinda barátom, nem tökéletlen, nincs is hosszú úton a tökéletesség felé: nem, hanem tökéletes minden pillanatában, minden bűn magában hordja már a kegyelmet is, minden kisgyermekben benne van már az aggastyán, a csecsemőben a halál, minden haldoklóban az örök élet. Nincs ember, aki a másikról meg tudná állapítani, mennyire jutott előbbre útján, a rablóban és kockajátékosban már ott várakozik Buddha, a bráhmanában ott várakozik a rabló. Az elmélyült meditációban megvan a lehetősége annak, hogy megszabaduljunk az időtől, hogy egyidejűleg lássunk minden valaha létezett, létező és eljövendő életet, és lám, abban minden jó, minden tökéletes, minden brahman. Azért az én szememben jó minden, ami van, a halál is, az élet is, a bűn is, a szentség is, a bölcsesség is, a balgaság is, mindennek olyannak kell lennie, amilyen, minden csak beleegyezésemre, csak engedelmességemre vár, mindenhez csupán szeretetteljes egyetértésem hiányzik, így hát nekem csak jó lehet, csak javamra válhat, és semmi sem árthat.

Если взять для примера какие-нибудь из этих полюсов, скажем, противоположность между святым и развратником, то наше уподобление сразу станет понятно. У человека есть возможность целиком отдаться духовной жизни, приблизиться к божественному началу, к идеалу святого. Есть у него, наоборот, возможность целиком отдаться своим инстинктам, свои чувственным желаньям и направить все свои усилия на получение мгновенной радости. Один путь ведет к святому, к мученику духа, к самоотречению во имя бога. Другой путь ведет к развратнику, к мученику инстинктов, к самоотречению во имя тлена. Так вот, мещанин пытается жить между обоими путями. в умеренной середине. Он никогда не отречется от себя, не отдастся ни опьянению, ни аскетизму, никогда не станет мучеником, никогда не согласится со своей гибелью, - напротив, его идеал - не самоотречение, а самосохранение, он не стремится ни к святости, ни к ее противоположности, безоговорочность, абсолютность ему нестерпимы, он хочет служить богу, но хочет служить и опьяненью, он хочет быть добродетельным, но хочет быть добродетельным, но хочет и пожить на земле в свое удовольствие. Короче говоря, он пытается осестьпосредине между крайностями, в умеренной и здоровой зоне, без яростных бурь и гроз, и это ему удается, хотя и ценой той полноты жизни и чувств, которую дает стремление к безоговорочности, абсолютности, крайности. Жить полной жизнью можно лишь ценой своего \"я\". А мещанин ничего не ставит выше своего \"я\" (очень, правда, недоразвитого).Ценой полноты, стало быть, он добивается сохранности и безопасности, получает вместо одержимости богом спокойную совесть, вместо наслаждения удовольствие, вместо свободы удобство, вместо смертельного зноя приятную температуру.

No man has ever been entirely and completelyhimself. Yet each one strives to become that--one in an awkward, the other in a more intelligent way, each asbest he can. Each man carries the vestiges of his birth--the slime and eggshells of his primeval past--with himto the end of his days. Some never become human, remaining frog, lizard, ant. Some are human above thewaist, fish below. Each represents a gamble on the part of nature in creation of the human. We all share thesame origin, our mothers; all of us come in at the same door.

Ali najlepši grad od svih koje znam je Kalv na Nagoldu, mali, stari švapski gradić ispod Švarcvalda. Kada dođem u Kalv, idem polako od železičke stanice nadole, pored katoličke crkve, pored “Orla i “Šumskog roga”, kroz Biskupovu ulicu pored Nagolda, pored Vajnštega ili do bara, onda preko reke i kroz donju Leder-uličicu, pa kroz jednu strmu, poprečnu, gore od trga, ispod trema većnice, pored dva jaka stara izvora, bacim pogled prema starim zgradama Latinske škole, u krčmarevoj bašti čujem kokoške kako kokodaču, okrenem se i idem ponovo nadole, pored “Jelena” i “Konjića”, a onda dugo stojim na mostu. To mi je najomiljenije mesto u gradiću, trg pored katedrale u firenci nije ništa u poređenju sa njim. Sada, kad sa lepog kamenog mosta gledam gore i dole, vidim kuće duž reke, a ne znam ko u njima živi. I kada iz jedne od njih gleda lpa devojka (kojih je u Kalvu uvek bilo), ja ne znam kako se zove. A pre trideset godina, iza svih ovih prozora nije bilo nijedne devojke i nijednog čoveka, nijedne stare žene, nijednog psa i nijedne mačke koju nisam znao. Nisu preko mosta prešla nijedna kola i nije kaskalo nijedno kljuse za koje nisam znao čiji su. A tako sam znao sve, mnoge školske drugove i njihove igre i podrugljive nadimke, pekarske radnje i njihovu robu, mesare i njihove pse, drveće, i gundelje, i ptice, i gnezda, vrste ogrozda u baštama. Upravo je zbog toga grad Kalv imao svoju jedinstvenu lepotu. Nema potrebe da ga opisujem, to stoji u skoro svim knjigama koje sam napisao. Da sam ostao u ovom lepom Kalvu, ne bi bilo potrebe da o njemu pišem. To mi nije bilo suđeno. Ali kada sada (kao što se do rata dešavalo jednom u nekoliko godina) ponovo sedim četvrt sata na ogradi mosta preko kojeg sam kao dečak hiljadu puta zabacio udicu, duboko i sa čudesnim uzbuđenjem osećam koliko je za mene lepo i značajno bilo to što sam doživeo: da sam jednom imao domovinu! da sam jednom u jednom malom mestu na Zemlji poznavao sve kuće i njihove prozore i sve ljude iza njih!Da sam drvo, još uvek bih bio tamo. Ali ne mogu da želim da se ponovi ono što je bilo. Povremeno uradim to u svojim snovima i pesmama, ali u stvarnosti ne želim. s vremena na vreme provedem po koju noć u nostalgiji za Kalvom, Ali da živim tamo, svakoga sata, danju i noću, imao bih nostalgiju za lepim, starim vremenima koja su bila pre trideset godina i koja su davno protekla ispod luka starog mosta. To ne bi bilo dobro. Za postupcima koji su učinjeni i za smrtima koje su se desile, ne treba žaliti.Samo ponekad treba da se tamo baci pogled, da se prošvrlja kroz ulicu Leder, da se četvrt sata stoji na mostu, pa makar to bilo samo u snu, pa makar i ne tako često.

But above all he was nauseated with himself, with his perfumed hair, with the smell of the wine from his mouth, with the soft, flabby appearance of his skin."},{"id":3153,"quote":"You must not give way to desires which you don't believe in. I know what you desire. You should, however, either be capable of renouncing these desires or feel wholly justified in having them. Once you are able to make your request in such a way that you will be quite certain of its fulfillment, then the fulfillment will come. But at present you alternate between desire and renunciation and are afraid all the time. All that must be overcome."},{"id":3154,"quote":"In dieser Stunde hörte Siddhartha auf, mit dem Schicksal zu kämpfen, hörte auf zu leiden. Auf seinem Gesicht blühte die Heiterkeit des Wissens, dem kein Wille mehr entgegensteht, das die Vollendung kennt, das einverstanden ist mit dem Fluß des Geschehens, mit dem Strom des Lebens, voll Mitleid, voll Mitlust, dem Strömen hingegeben, der Einheit zugehörig."},{"id":3155,"quote":"the Game of games had developed into a kind of universal language through which the players could express values and set these in relation to one another. Throughout its history the Game was closely allied with music, and usually proceeded according to musical or mathematical rules. One theme, two themes, or three themes were stated, elaborated, varied, and underwent a development quite similar to that of the theme in a Bach fugue or a concerto movement. A Game, for example, might start from a given astronomical configuration, or from the actual theme of a Bach fugue, or from a sentence out of Leibniz or the Upanishads, and from this theme, depending on the intentions and talents of the player, it could either further explore and elaborate the initial motif or else enrich its expressiveness by allusions to kindred concepts. Beginners learned how to establish parallels, by means of the Game’s symbols, between a piece of classical music and the formula for some law of nature. Experts and Masters of the Game freely wove the initial theme into unlimited combinations."},{"id":3156,"quote":"in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it."},{"id":3157,"quote":"La vida de todo hombre es un camino hacia sí mismo, la tentativa de un camino, la huella de un sendero.

Era un error desear nuevos dioses, y completamente falso querer dar algo al mundo. No existía ningún deber, ninguno, para el hombre consciente, excepto el de buscarse a sí mismo, afirmarse en su interior, tantear un camino hacia adelante sin preocuparse de la meta a que pudiera conducir. (...) Aquellas imágenes no valían nada. Yo no estaba en el mundo para escribir, predicar o pintar; ni yo ni nadie estaba para eso. Tales cosas sólo podían surgir marginalmente. La misión verdadera de cada uno era llegar a sí mismo. Se podía llegar a poeta o a loco, a profeta o a criminal; ese no es asunto de uno: a fin de cuentas, carecía de toda importancia. Lo que importaba era encontrar su propio destino, no un destino cualquiera, y vivirlo por completo.
