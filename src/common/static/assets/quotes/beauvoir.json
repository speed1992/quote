It was to escape this dilemma that the Stoics preached indifference. We could indeed assert our freedom against all constraint if we agreed to renounce the particularity of our projects. If a door refuses to open, let us accept not opening it and there we are free. But by doing that, one manages only to save an abstract notion of freedom. It is emptied of all content and all truth.

Her ikisi için de aşk, kendini verişte benliğini tanımak, evreni zenginleştirmek biçimine girecektir. Gerorge Gusdorf, la Connaissance de Soi ( İnsanın kendini tanıması) adlı yapıtında, erkeklerin aşktan, sevgiden beklediğini pek güzel özetlemektedir.Aşk, bizi bizden, dar kalıbımızdan kurtararak kendi benliğimizi gösterir bize. Bize yabancı olan ve bizi tamamlayan varlıkla ilinti kurduğumuz an kendimizi olumlarız. Bir bilgi türü olan sevgi, nicedir içinde yaşadığımız görünüme bile yeni nitelikler kazandırır, önümüzde yeni gökler, yeni topraklar açılır. İşin en büyük sırrı da buradadır zaten: dünya bir başka varlıktır, ben de bir başka varlık’ım. Ve sevdiğim an, bunu bilen tek kişi olmaktan çıkarım. Daha da ileri giderek, bunu bana öğretenin işte bu ikinci kişi, (sevdiğim yabancı varlık) olduğunu söyleyebiliriz. Öyleyse, kadın erkeğin kendi varlığının bilincine varmasında en önemli rolü oynamaktadır.Bir delikanlı için aşk konusunda çıraklık etmenin önemi de işte buradan gelmektedir: Stendhal’ın, Malraux’un “ben de bir başka varlık’ım dedikleri anda duydukları engin zevki hepimiz biliyoruz. Ancak, Gusdorf, şu satırları yazarken haksızdır: “aynı şekilde, erkek de, kadın için, kendi varlığını tanımada kullanacağı vazgeçilmez bir aracıdır”, çünkü, bugün erkeğin durumu kadınınkinin aynı değildir; sevgi ilişkisinde erkek başka bir görünüşte ortaya çıkmakta, bu yeni görünüş de kişiliğine katılmakta, ama temek bir varlığı aynı kalmaktadır. Kadın da onun gibi kendisi için var olan bir varlık olabilseydi, sevgiden aynı yararı sağlayabilecekti; bu ise, onun iktisadi açıdan bağımsız olmasını, kendine özgü birtakım erekleri bulunmasını ve kimsenin aracılığı olmadan, kendisi, topluluk yönünde aşabilmesini gerektirir. ……Erkekler, istek üzerine, sevginin, kasın için en yüce bütünleniş olduğunu ileri sürmüşlerdir. Nietzsche: “Kadın olarak seven bir kadın, bu sevginin yardımıyla, çok daha derinlemesine kadınlaşır” demiş.…..Kadın, güçsüzlüğü değil, güçlülüğü içinde; kendinden kaçmak değil, kendini bulabilmek; var olmaktan istifa etmek değil, varlığını olumlamak üzere sevebildiği gün, aşk, hem onun hem de erkek için korkunç bir tehlike olmaktan çıkıp bir yaşam kaynağı haline gelecektir.…..Erkek titiz bir iyi niyete sahipse, evli ya da sevdalı çiftlerde, karşılıklı bir cömertlik içinde, tam bir eşitliğe kavuşmak mümkün olmaktadır.…..”"},{"id":531,"quote":"It is a mistake to seek in fantasies the key to concrete behaviour; for fantasies are created and cherished as fantasies.

In Plutarch Lied Pierrefeu rightly says that in war there is no victory which can not be regarded as unsuccessful, for the objective which one aims at is the total annihilation of the enemy and this result is never attained; yet there are wars which are won and wars which are lost. So is it with any activity; failure and success are two aspects of reality which at the start are not perceptible. That is what makes criticism so easy and art so difficult: the critic is always in a good position to show the limits that every artist gives himself in choosing himself; painting is not given completely either in Giotto or Titian or Cezanne; it is sought through the centuries and is never finished; a painting in which all pictorial problems are resolved is really inconceivable; painting itself is this movement toward its own reality; it is not the vain displacement of a millstone turning in the void; it concretizes itself on each canvas as an absolute existence. Art and science do not establish themselves despite failure but through it; which does not prevent there being truths and errors, masterpieces and lemons, depending upon whether the discovery or the painting has or has not known how to win the adherence of human consciousnesses; this amounts to saying that failure, always ineluctable, is in certain cases spared and in others not."},{"id":680,"quote":"The passionate man seeks possession; he seeks to attain being.

All the creation myths express this conviction that is precious to the male, for example, the Genesis legend, which, through Christianity, has spanned Western civilization. Eve was not formed at the same time as man; she was not made either from a different substance or from the same clay that Adam was modeled from: she was drawn from the first male’s flank. Even her birth was not autonomous; God did not spontaneously choose to create her for herself and to be directly worshiped in turn: he destined her for man; he gave her to Adam to save him from loneliness, her spouse is her origin and her finality; she is his complement in the inessential mode. Thus, she appears a privileged prey. She is nature raised to the transparency of consciousness; she is a naturally submissive consciousness. And therein lies the marvelous hope that man has often placed in woman: he hopes to accomplish himself as being through carnally possessing a being while making confirmed in his freedom by a docile freedom. No man would consent to being a woman, but all want there to be women. “Thank God for creating woman. “Nature is good because it gave men woman.” In these and other similar phrases, man once more asserts arrogantly and naively that his presence in this world is an inevitable fact and a right, that of woman is a simple accident—but a fortunate one. Appearing as the Other, woman appears at the same time as a plenitude of being by opposition to the nothingness of existence that man experiences in itself; the Other, posited as object in the subject’s eyes, is posited as in-itself, thus as being. Woman embodies positively the lack the existent carries in his heart, and man hopes to realize himself by finding himself through her.”"},{"id":864,"quote":"Trudno bowiem mężczyźnie ocenić ogromne znaczenie dyskryminacji społecznych, które na zewnątrz wydają się błahe, a których konsekwencje moralne i intelektualne tkwią w kobiecie tak głęboko, że wydają się mieć źródło w jej pierwotnej strukturze."},{"id":865,"quote":"Mi acción no es para otro sino lo que él mismo la hace ser: ¿cómo puedo, pues, saber de antemano lo que hago?; y si no lo sé, ¿cómo puedo proponerme obrar por la humanidad?"},{"id":866,"quote":"It was not murder that fulfilled Sade's erotic nature; it was literature."},{"id":867,"quote":"«No se muere de haber nacido, ni de haber vivido, ni de vejez.

Se la società dovesse pagare quel lavoro è evidente che ciò aumenterebbe enormemente tutte le sue spese. È un grandissimo vantaggio per la società avere donne che fanno questo enorme lavoro per niente.Come ottenere allora che la donna faccia questo lavoro? Bisogna condizionarla. Dato che è difficile convincerla che essa ha la vocazione di lavare i patti, si è trovato qualcosa di meglio.Si esalta la maternità, perché la maternità offre il modo di tenere la donna in casa e di farle fare le faccende domestiche. Invece di dire alla bambina di due, tre o quattro anni: «Sei destinata a lavare i piatti» le si dice «Sei destinata ad essere madre»; le regalano bambole, si esalta la maternità, in modo che quando diventa una ragazza non pensa ad altro, pensa soltanto a sposarsi e ad avere bambini. La si è convinta che non sarà una donna completa se non avrà bambini. Quando una donna non ha figli, si dice: «Non è una vera donna», ma quando un uomo non ha figli non si dice: «Non è un vero uomo».Bisogna dunque che la donna sia asservita alla maternità. Se almeno avesse la libertà di essere madre quando vuole, nella misura in cui lo vuole, pianificando le nascite dei figli, avrebbe molta piú libertà in tutti i campi. Potrebbe rivaleggiare con l’uomo sul piano professionale, non sarebbe per tutta la vita inchiodata in casa; e cosí si porrebbe il problema di perché non debba essere l’uomo a lavare i piatti.Per evitare che ciò avvenga, bisogna dunque imporre la maternità alla donna e imporgliela suo malgrado. Per questa ragione da quando esiste la possibilità di controllare le nascite, non si è mai cercato di facilitarne la messa in pratica, al punto che in Francia attualmente c’è solo il 7 per cento di donne che si servono di metodi anticoncezionali. È anche per questo che il governo, in questo momento, sta ritirando tutte le sovvenzioni alla Pianificazione familiare, la sola organizzazione che si è occupata di informare le donne. Il governo, tuttavia, riconosce di non avere alcuna soluzione di ricambio; ed è una cosa molto grave. Non solo si sopprime la Pianificazione familiare e le si tolgono le possibilità di agire, ma non si prevede niente al suo posto. Si impedisce dunque alle donne di difendersi dal concepimento quando non lo desiderano. E cosí rimangono incinte loro malgrado.Non resta allora altro che procurarsi l’aborto, e cosí fanno un milione di donne francesi ogni anno, malgrado questa legge che di fatto non impedisce niente e che quindi non ha alcun senso. Ogni tanto si dà ad essa un’apparenza di esistenza, accusando qualche donna, sempre scelta tra le piú diseredate, perché non si è mai vista la moglie di un magistrato, di un ministro o di un grande industriale seduta al posto in cui stanno le accusate di oggi.Eppure si può essere sicuri che ci sono altrettanti aborti in quegli ambienti come negli altri. La legge opprime tutte le donne, anche quelle che sono privilegiate.Nella mia vita ho visto arrivare a casa mia in lacrime non solo operaie o impiegate, ma donne borghesi che avevano denaro; una volta ho perfino aiutato la moglie di un grande direttore di banca. Nonostante tutto, le donne sono isolate; anche col denaro, non si hanno sempre gli indirizzi che occorrono e non si sa a chi rivolgersi.Come dicevo in principio, si è inculcato nell’animo delle donne un tale senso di colpa, che l’aborto diviene per loro qualcosa di traumatizzante, mentre non lo sarebbe affatto se avvenisse in condizioni legali."},{"id":874,"quote":"Today, the majority of workers are exploited.

But to compare the use that, within their limits, men and women make of their freedom is a priori meaningless, precisely because they use it freely. In various forms, the traps of bad faith and the mystifications of seriousness are lying in wait for both of them; freedom is entire in each. However, because of the fact that in woman this freedom remains abstract and empty, it cannot authentically assume itself except in revolt: this is the only way open to those who have no chance to build anything; they must refuse the limits of their situation and seek to open paths to the future; resignation is only a surrender and an evasion; for woman there is no other way out than to work for her liberation."},{"id":946,"quote":"Ça ne rapproche pas, le téléphone, ça confirme les distances."},{"id":947,"quote":"Scents, patterns of light and shade, winds and hurricanes — all pulsed inwardly through my own sinews and veins: so much so, indeed, that the throb of my blood stream, the swarming growth of my cells, the whole mystery of life housed within me seemed to be echoed by the shrilling cicadas, the gusts of wind that shook the trees, and the faint crunch of the moss as I trod it underfoot."},{"id":948,"quote":"The fundamental fault of the nihilist is that, challenging all given values, he does not find, beyond their ruin, the importance of that universal, absolute end which freedom itself is. It is possible that, even in this failure, a man may nevertheless keep his taste for an existence which he originally felt as a joy. Hoping for no justification, he will nevertheless take delight in living. He will not turn aside from things which he does not believe in. He will seek a pretext in them for a gratuitous display of activity. Such a man is what is generally called an adventurer. He throws himself into his undertakings with zest, into exploration, conquest, war, speculation, love, politics, but he does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest. He likes action for its own sake. He finds joy in spreading through the world a freedom which remains indifferent to its content. Whether the taste for adventure appears to be based on nihilistic despair or whether it is born directly from the experience of the happy days of childhood, it always implies that freedom is realized as an independence in regard to the serious world and that, on the other hand, the ambiguity of existence is felt not as a lack but in its positive aspect. This attitude dialectically envelops nihilism’s opposition to the serious and the opposition to nihilism by existence as such. But, of course, the concrete history of an individual does not necessarily espouse this dialectic, by virtue of the fact that his condition is wholly present to him at each moment and because his freedom before it is, at every moment, total. From the time of his adolescence a man can define himself as an adventurer.

What it was saying he could not be translated into words; it was said in painting and no other language could have expressed its meaning; but it spoke. He advanced a few paces. Under his attentive gaze, all the pictures came alive; they awoke memories more ancient than the beginning of the world; they evoked the unpredictable face of the earth far beyond the revolutions to come; they exposed the secrets of a jagged coastline, of a dessert sprinkled with shells, as they remained solitary within themselves, protected from any conscience. Statues without faces, men turned to pillars of salt, landscapes scorched by the flames of death, oceans frozen into immobility of the absolute instant: these were the thousand shapes of absence.

Popular opinion is quite right in admiring a man who, having been ruined or having suffered an accident, knows how to gain the upper hand, that is, renew his engagement in the world, thereby strongly asserting the independence of freedom in relation to thing. Thus, when the sick Van Gogh calmly accepted the prospect of a future in which he would be unable to paint any more, there was no sterile resignation. For him painting was a personal way of life and of communication with others which in another form could be continued even in an asylum. The past will be integrated and freedom will be confirmed in a renunciation of this kind. It will be lived in both heartbreak and joy. In heartbreak, because the project is then robbed of its particularity — it sacrifices its flesh and blood. But in joy, since at the moment one releases his hold, he again finds his hands free and ready to stretch out toward a new future. But this act of passing beyond is conceivable only if what the content has in view is not to bar up the future, but, on the contrary, to plan new possibilities. This brings us back by another route to what we had already indicated. My freedom must not seek to trap being but to disclose it. The disclosure is the transition from being to existence.

Chegando a Paris, o que desejava mais ardentemente era \"uma mulher encantadora; nós nos adoraremos, ela conhecerá minha alma\"... Velho, escreve na poeira as iniciais das mulheres que mais amou. \"Creio que foi o devaneio que preferi a tudo\", confia-nos ele. E são imagens demulheres que lhe alimentaram os sonhos; a lembrança delas anima as paisagens. \"A linha de rochedos aproximando-se de Arbois, creio, e vindo de Dôle pela estrada principal, foi para mim uma imagem sensível e evidente da alma de Métilde.\" A música, a pintura, a arquitetura, tudo o que amou, amou-o com uma alma de amante infeliz; quando passeia em Roma, a cada página, uma mulher aparece; nas saudades, nos desejos, nas tristezas, nas alegriasque elas suscitaram-lhe, conheceu o gosto do próprio coração; a elas é que deseja como juizes. Freqüenta-lhes os salões, procura mostrar-se brilhante aos seus olhos, deveu-lhes suas maiores felicidades, suas penas; foram sua principal ocupação. Prefere seu amor a toda amizade e sua amizade à dos homens; mulheres inspiram seus livros, figuras de mulheres os povoam; é em grande parte para elas que escreve. \"Corro o risco de ser lido em 1900 pelas almas que amo, as Mme Roland, as Mélanie Guibert...\" As mulheres foram a própria subsistência de sua vida. De onde lhe veio esse privilégio? Esse terno amigo das mulheres, e precisamente porque as ama em sua verdade, não crê no mistério feminino; nenhuma essência define de uma vez por todas a mulher; a idéia de um \"eterno feminino\" parece-lhe pedante e ridículo. \"Pedantes repetem há dois mil anos que as mulheres têm o espírito mais vivo e os homens, mais solidez; que as mulheres têm mais delicadeza nas idéias e os homens, maior capacidade de atenção. Um basbaque de Paris que passeava outrora pelos jardins de Versalhes concluía, do que via, que as árvores nascem podadas.\" As diferenças que se observam entre os homens e as mulheres refletem as de sua situação. Por exemplo, por que não seriam as mulheres mais romanescas do que seus amantes? \"Uma mulher com seu bastidor de bordar, trabalho insípido que só ocupa as mãos, pensa no amante, enquanto este galopando no campo com seu esquadrão é preso se faz um movimento em falso.\" Acusam igualmente as mulheres de carecerem de bom senso. \"As mulheres preferem as emoções à razão; é muito simples: como em virtude de nossos costumes vulgares elas não são encarregadas de nenhum negócio na família, a razão nunca lhes ê útil.. . Encarregai vossa mulher de tratar de vossos interesses com os arrendatários de duas de vossas propriedades; aposto que as contas serão mais bem feitas do que por vós.\" Se a História revela-nos tão pequeno número de gênios femininos é porque a sociedade as priva de quaisquer meios de expressão: \"Todos os gênios que nascem mulheres estão perdidos para a felicidade do público; desde que o acaso lhes dê os meios de se revelarem, vós as vereís desenvolver os mais difíceis talentos.\" O pior handicap que devem suportar é a educação com que as embrutecem; o opressor esforça-se sempre por diminuir os que oprime; é propositadamente que o homem recusa às mulheres quaisquer possibilidades. \"Deixemos ociosas nelas as qualidades mais brilhantes e mais ricas de felicidade para elas mesmas e para nós.\" Aos dez anos, a menina é mais fina e viva do que seu irmão; com vinte, o moleque é homem de espírito e a moça \"uma grande idiota desajeitada, tímida e com medo de urna aranha\"; o erro está na formação que teve.

Zaobchádzajú s nami ako s hračkami... robia si z nás práčky a kuchárky."},{"id":1049,"quote":"The fact is that the individual, though its genotypic sex is fixed at fertilisation, can be profoundly affected by the environment in which it develops. In the ants, bees, and termites the larval nutrition determines whether the genotypic female individual will become a fully developed female (‘queen’) or a sexually retarded worker. In these cases the whole organism is affected; but the gonads do not play a part in establishing the sexual differences of the body, or soma. In the vertebrates, however, the hormones secreted by the gonads are the essential regulators. Numerous experiments show that by varying the hormonal (endocrine) situation, sex can be profoundly affected. Grafting and castration experiments on adult animals and man have contributed to the modern theory of sexuality, according to which the soma is in a way identical in male and female vertebrates. It may be regarded as a kind of neutral element upon which the influence of the gonad imposes the sexual characteristics. Some of the hormones secreted by the gonad act as stimulators, others as inhibitors. Even the genital tract itself is somatic, and embryological investigations show that it develops in the male or female direction from an indifferent and in some respects hermaphroditic condition under the hormonal influence. Intersexuality may result when the hormones are abnormal and hence neither one of the two sexual potentialities is exclusively realised."},{"id":1050,"quote":"Mi ero voluta senza limiti ed ero informe come l'infinito. La cosa paradossale è che mi accorsi di questa deficienza proprio nel momento in cui scoprivo la mia individualità: la mia pretesa al'universale fin allora mi era apparsa ovvi, e invece, ecco che diveniva un tratto di carattere. \"Simone si interessa di tutto\". Mi trovavo delimitata dal mio rifiuto dei limiti."},{"id":1051,"quote":"As soon as one considers a system abstractly and theoretically, one puts himself, in effect, on the plane of the universal, thus, of the infinite. That is why reading the Hegelian system is so comforting. I remember having experienced a great feeling of calm on reading Hegel in the impersonal framework of the Bibliotheque Nationale in August 1940. But once I got into the street again, into my life, out of the system, beneath a real sky, the system was no longer of any use to me: what it had offered me, under a show of the infinite, was the consolations of death; and I again wanted to live in the midst of living men. I think that, inversely, existentialism does not offer to the reader the consolations of an abstract evasion: existentialism proposes no evasion. On the contrary, its ethics is experienced in the truth of life, and it then appears as the only proposition of salvation which one can address to men. Taking on its own account Descartes' revolt against the evil genius, the pride of the thinking reed in the face of the universe which crushes him, it asserts that, despite his limits, through them, it is up to each one to fulfill his existence as an absolute. Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite. And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive. There is a very old saying which goes: \"Do what you must, come what may.\" That amounts to saying in a different way that the result is not external to the good will which fulfills itself in aiming at it. If it came to be that each man did what he must, existence would be saved in each one without there being any need of dreaming of a paradise where all would be reconciled in death."},{"id":1052,"quote":"To exist genuinely is not to deny this spontaneous movement of my transcendence, but only to refuse to lose myself in it."},{"id":1053,"quote":"No dia que for possível à mulher amar em sua força e não em sua fraqueza, não para fugir de si mesma, mas para se encontrar, não para se renunciar, mas para se afirmar, nesse dia o amor tornar-se-á para ela, como para o homem, fonte de vida e não perigo mortal."},{"id":1054,"quote":"Woman is lost. Where are the women? Today's women are not women\"; we have seen what these mysterious slogans mean. In the eyes of men — and of the legions of women who see through these eyes — it is not enough to have a woman's body or to take on the female function as lover and mother to be a \"real woman\"; it is possible for the subject to claim autonomy through sexuality and maternity; the \"real woman\" is one who accepts herself as Other. The duplicitous attitude of men today creates a painful split for women; they accept, for the most part, that woman be a peer, an equal; and yet they continue to oblige her to remain the inessential; for her, these two destinies are not reconcilable; she hesitates between them without being exactly suited to either, and that is the source of her lack of balance."},{"id":1055,"quote":"When a young sixteen-year old Nazi died crying, “Heil Hitler! he was not guilty, and it was not he whom we hated but his masters.
