The fog clears, and new energy makes you run up the steps in front of you. Be emptier and cry like reed instruments cry. Emptier, write secrets with the reed pen. When you're full of food and drink, Satan sits where your spirit should, an ugly metal statue in place of the Kaaba. When you fast, good habits gather like friends who want to help. Fasting is Solomon's ring. Don't give it to some illusion and lose your power, but even if you have, if you've lost all will and control, they come back when you fast, like soldiers appearing out of the ground, pennants flying above them. A table descends to your tents, Jesus' table.

Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief. But there’s a difference with this dream. Everything cruel and unconscious done in the illusion of the present world, all that does not fade away at the death-waking. It stays, and it must be interpreted. All the mean laughing, all the quick, sexual wanting, those torn coats of Joseph, they change into powerful wolves that you must face. The retaliation that sometimes comes now, the swift, payback hit, is just a boy’s game to what the other will be. You know about circumcision here. It’s full castration there! And this groggy time we live, this is what it’s like:      A man goes to sleep in the town where he has always lived, and he dreams he’s living in another town.      In the dream, he doesn’t remember the town he’s sleeping in his bed in. He believes the reality of the dream town. The world is that kind of sleep. The dust of many crumbled cities settles over us like a forgetful doze, but we are older than those cities.           We began as a mineral. We emerged into plant life and into the animal state, and then into being human, and always we have forgotten our former states, except in early spring when we slightly recall being green again.      That’s how a young person turns toward a teacher. That’s how a baby leans toward the breast, without knowing the secret of its desire, yet turning instinctively. Humankind is being led along an evolving course, through this migration of intelligences, and though we seem to be sleeping, there is an inner wakefulness that directs the dream, and that will eventually startle us back to the truth of who we are."},{"id":2725,"quote":"Drink all your passion,and be a disgrace."},{"id":2726,"quote":"O lovers, lovers it is timeto set out from the world.I hear a drum in my soul's earcoming from the depths of the stars.Our camel driver is at work;the caravan is being readied.He asks that we forgive himfor the disturbance he has caused us,He asks why we travelers are asleep.Everywhere the murmur of departure;the stars, like candlesthrust at us from behind blue veils,and as if to make the invisible plain,a wondrous people have come forth."},{"id":2727,"quote":"Life's waters flow from darkness, Search the darkness, don't run from it."},{"id":2728,"quote":"چــه دانســتـم که این سـودا مـرا زیـن ســان کـُنـد مجــنـوندلـم را دوزخــی سـازد دو چـشــمـم را کـُنـد جـیـحــونچــه دانســتـم که سـیـلابی مـرا ناگـاه بـربـایـدچـو کَـشــتی ام دراندازد میـانِ قـُلزم پُـر خــوننهــنـگی هـم برآرد سـر خـُورَد آن آبِ دریا راچـُنـان دریـایِ بی‌پـایـان شــود بی‌آب چــون هــامـونچـو این تبـدیـل‌هـا آمـد نـه هـامون مـاند و نه دریاچــه دانم مـن دگـر چـون شـد که چـون غـرق اسـت در بـی‌چـون"},{"id":2729,"quote":"If one sense breaks free from its bonds having a glimpse of the invisible it makes it apparent to all the others.

At times we flow toward the Beloved  like a dancing stream.  At times we are still water  held in His pitcher.  At times we boil in a pot  turning to vapor – that is the job of the Beloved.  He breathes into my ear  until my soul  takes on His fragrance.  He is the soul of my soul – How can I escape?  But why would any soul in this world  want to escape from the Beloved?  He will melt your pride  making you thin as a strand of hair,  Yet do not trade, even for both worlds,  One strand of His hair.  We search for Him here and there  while looking right at Him.  Sitting by His side we ask,  \"O Beloved, where is the Beloved?\"  Enough with such questions! – Let silence take you to the core of life.

What sort ofperson says that he or she wants to be polished and pure, then complains about beinghandled roughly? Love is a lawsuit where harsh evidence must be brought in. To settlethe case, the judge must see evidence. You've heard that every buried treasure has a snake guarding it. Kiss the snake to discover the treasure! The severe treatment is not towardyou, but the qualities that block your growth. A rug beater doesn't beat the rug, butrather the dirt. A horse trainer switches not the horse, but the going wrong.

Someone asks, \"Don't you worryabout God's wrath when you spank a child?\" \"I'm not spanking my child, but the demonin him.\" When a mother screams, \"Get out of here!\" she means the mean part of the child.Don't run from those who scold, and don't turn away from cleansing conflict, or you willremain weak.

Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how should I beguile him with such a form and likeness? He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread? He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world that I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss. He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter sighs, to beguile him with lamentation. I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering. Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what’s hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden. He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry.

We may reprimand our friends, but wenever reprimand a stranger.Now there are levels of reprimand. When aperson is stung by it and sees the truth in it, thatis a sign that God loves them and cares for them.But if the reprimand flies by that person withoutcausing any pain at all, then this is no sign of love.When a carpet is beaten to get rid of the dust,intelligent people do not call that a reprimand.But if a woman beats her own darling child, thenthat is called a reprimand and is a proof of herlove. Therefore, as long as you find pain andregret within yourself, that is a proof of God’slove and guidance.If you find fault in your brother or sister, thefault you see in them is within yourself. The trueSufi is like a mirror where you see your ownimage, for “The believer is a mirror of their fellowbelievers.” Get rid of those faults in yourself,because what bothers you in them bothers you in yourself.An elephant was led to a well to drink. Seeing itself in the water, it shied away. It thought it was shying away from another elephant. It did not realize it was shying away from its own self. All evil qualities—oppression, hatred, envy, greed, mercilessness, pride—when they are within yourself, they bring no pain. When you see them in another, then you shy away and feel the pain. We feel no disgust at our own scab and abscess. We will dip our infected hand into our food and lick our fingers without turning in the least bit squeamish. But if we see a tiny abscess or half a scratch on another’s hand, we shy away from that person’s food and have no stomach for it whatsoever. Evil qualities are just like scabs and abscesses; when they are within us they cause no pain, but when we see them even to a small degree in another, then we feel pain and disgust. Just as you shy away from your brother or sister, so you should excuse them for shying away from you. The pain you feel comes from those faults, and they see the same faults. The seeker of truth is a mirror for their neighbors. But those who cannot feel the sting of truth are not mirrors to anyone but themselves.”"},{"id":3370,"quote":"INWARD OCCUPATION When Satan sees, to the left or right, anyone who is perfect, he becomes ill with envy, for every wretch whose stack has been burnt is unwilling that anyone else’s candle should be lighted.

When its gaze is by the Light of God, to such a light what can be hidden? Though all lights are the Light of God, call not all of those the eternal Light. Eternal light is that which is the Light of God, transient light is the attribute of flesh and body. The light in this mortal eye is a fire, save for that eye which God anoints with surmeh {collyrium}. His fire became light for the sake of Abraham; the eye of reason became in quality like the eye of an ass. O God, the bird of the eye which has seen Your bounty flies in Your air. The Pole, he who is the sky of the skies, is on the lookout in search of You; Either grant him vision to see You, or do not dismiss him on account of this fault. Make tearful the eye of your soul every moment, guard it against the snare of human stature and cheek.

If water is confined in a tank, the wind sucks it up; for the wind is an elemental spirit, powerful and free.

The perfumes of our good words ascend even unto Him, ascending from us whither He knoweth.2 Our breaths soar up with the choice words, as a gift from us, to the abode of everlastingness; Then comes to us the recompense of our praise, a recompense manifold, from God the Merciful; Then He causes us to seek more good words, so that His servant may win more of His Mercy.
