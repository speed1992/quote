Therefore the sage does not proceed in such a way, but illuminates all in the light of Heaven.

Kaikista niistä kuuluu ikään kuin kuohuavan veden pauhua tai kohinaa, ne ulvovat ja huokaavat, mylvivät kuin eläimet, ujeltavat, valittavat ja viheltävät. Edellä kulkeva tuuli laulaa jyy ja perässä seuraava säestää jung. Kun tuuli puhaltaa lempeästi, kuulet hiljaisia sointuja, mutta myrskyn synnyttämät soinnut ovat jyhkeitä; ja kun ankara tuuli asettuu, jokainen onkalo vaikenee. Etkö ole koskaan nähnyt, miten kaikki puut huojuvat huojuvat, taipuvat taipuvat?"},{"id":385,"quote":"Atlar karada yaşar, ot yer ve su içer. Memnun olduklarında boyunlarını birbirine dolayıp birbirlerine sürtünürler. Sinirlendiklerinde dönüp birbirlerini çiftelerler. Bunların hepsi atların içgüdüleridir. Ama atlar boyunduruk altına alınıp süslendiklerinde çıtaları kırmayı, boyunlarını kaldırmayı, vahşi davranmayı, tükürmeyi ve dizginlerini ısırmayı bilirler. Bu nedenle atların insanlara karşı koyacak kadar kurnaz olması Bo Le'nin hatasıdır.Hükümdar Hexu'nun zamanında insanlar ne yapacaklarını ve nereye gideceklerini bilmeden hayatlarını boşa harcardı. Karınları toktu ve mutluydular. İnsanların yapabileceği tek şey buydu. Bilgeler dünyaya gelince, dünyayı düzeltmek için müzik ve törenleri icat ettiler; bilgi ve servet için sonsuz çaba göstermeye başlayan insanların kalbini rahatlatmak için insanlığı ve doğruluğu artırdılar.

The question Zhuangzi faces is indeed among the most fundamental human problems: How should I live my life? Which of the alternate courses should I take as my guide? How is it that I come to choose one course over another? Given that there are alternate ways to see things, why do I, and why should I, see things the way I do rather than another way and thus follow one path rather than another? Zhuangzi’s response to this problem, simply stated, is this: This question can never be answered in the terms in which it has been put, because our understanding consciousness can never know why it sees things one way rather than another, can never ultimately ground its own judgments, and is actually in no position to serve as a guide for living. To consciously weigh alternatives, apply your understanding to making a decision about what is best, and then deliberately follow the course you have decided on—this is the fundamental structure of all purposive activity and conscious knowledge, the basis of all ethics, all philosophy, all politics, all human endeavors at improvement, and this is precisely what Zhuangzi seems to consider ridiculous and impossible. Knowledge is unreliable; Will is unreliable; Tradition is unreliable; Intuition is unreliable; Logic is unreliable; Faith is unreliable. But what else is there?”"},{"id":388,"quote":"You will always find an answer in the sound of water."},{"id":389,"quote":"Therefore, in a time of Perfect Virtue, the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze is steady and mild. In such an age, mountains have no paths or trails, lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form their flocks and herds; grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them about or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue, men live the same as birds and beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who then knows anything about “gentleman or “petty man”? Dull and unwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity, the people attain their true nature.”"},{"id":390,"quote":"Ah, said Lien Shu, “it is true that a blind person cannot appreciate beautiful patterns and forms, and the deaf cannot appreciate the music of bells and drums.

He beats the whirlwind and rises ninety thousand li, setting off on the sixth month gale.\" Wavering heat, bits of dust, living things blowing each other about – the sky looks very blue.

All this is why you cannot avoid disasters.I have heard the great fulfillment man say, “The boastful have done nothing worthwhile, those who do something worthwhile will see it fade, fame soon disappears. There are few who can forget success and fame and just return to being ordinary citizens again! The Tao moves all, but the perfect man does not stand in its light, his Virtue moves all, but he does not seek fame. He is empty and plain, and seems crazy. Anonymous, abdicating power, he has no interest in work or fame. So he doesn’t criticize others and they don’t criticize him. The perfect man is never heard, so why, Sir, do you so want to be?”"}]
