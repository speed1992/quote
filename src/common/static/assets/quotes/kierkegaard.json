Atunci când pericolul suprem este moartea, ea speră în viaţă; cine a cunoscut însă pericolul şi mai îngrozitor, speră în moarte. Dacă, aşadar, pericolul este atât de mare încât se pun speranţele în moarte, disperarea constă în absenţa speranţei de a putea măcar muri. Disperarea este aşadar boala de moarte, această contradicţie chinuitoare, această boală aflată în sine, de a muri veşnic, de a muri fără totuşi să mori şi de a muri moartea.

Dacă omul ar muri de disperare aşa cum se moare de o boală, atunci ar trebui că eternul din el, sinele, să poată muri în acelaşi sens în care trupul moare dintr-o boală.

Totuşi disperarea înseamnă tocmai să te macini în interior, dar este o măcinare neputincioasă a unui sine care nu este în stare de ceea ce vrea. Disperarea vrea însă să se nimicească, ceea ce îi este peste puteri, iar această slăbiciune este o nouă formă de a se roade pe dinăuntru, în care totuşi disperarea din nou nu poate ce vrea, să se autodistrugă, ci avem de-a face cu o potenţare sau cu legea ridicării la putere. Această măcinare este ceea ce aţâţă sau e incendiul glacial din disperare, o măcinare întoarsă mereu spre interior şi care roade tot mai adânc şi tot mai neputincios din sine. Pentru cel ce disperă nu este o consolare nici măcar faptul că disperarea pe el nu-l distruge; dimpotrivă, tocmai această consolare este supliciul care ţine în viaţă disperarea mistuitoare şi viaţa în durere mistuitoare. Căci tocmai de aceea el nu a disperat, ci disperă: pentru că nu se poate distruge, nu se poate lepăda de sine, nu se poate nimici.

Her beauty, her quiet occupation with herself, fixes his attention upon her ; but only sadness prevails in his soul, no wild desire stirs in it.

The merman plucks up courage, he approaches Agnes, he wins her love, he hopes for his deliverance. But Agnes was no quiet maiden, she was fond of the roar of the sea, and the sad sighing beside the inland lake pleased her only because then she seethed more strongly within. She would be off and away, she would rush wildly out into the infinite with the merman whom she loved – so she incites the memman. She disdained his humility, now pride awakens. And the sea roars and the waves foam and the merman embraces Agnes and plunges with her into the deep.

Is it love? Perhaps. It is a presentiment of it, its dream. It still lacks energy. Her embrace is comprehensive, as the cloud enfolding the transfigured one, detached as a breeze, soft as the fondling of a flower; she kisses me unspecifically, as the sky kisses the sea, gently and quietly, as the dew kisses a flower, solemnly as the sea kisses the image of the moon. I would call her passion at this moment a naive passion. When the change has been made and I begin to draw back in earnest, she will call on everything she has to captivate me. She has no other means for this purpose than the erotic itself, except that this will now appear on a quite different scale. It then becomes a weapon in her hand which she wields against me. I then have the reflected passion. She fights for her own sake because she knows I possess the erotic; she fights for her own sake so as to overcome me. She herself is in need of a higher form of the erotic. What I taught her to suspect by arousing her, my coldness now teaches her to understand but in such a way that she thinks it is she herself who discovers it. So she wants to take me by surprise; she wants to believe that she has outstripped me in audacity, and that makes me her prisoner. Her passion then becomes specific, energetic, conclusive, dialectical; her kiss total, her embrace without hesitation.—In me she seeks her freedom and finds it the better the more firmly I encompass her. The engagement bursts. When that has happened she needs a little rest, so that nothing unseemly will emerge from this wild tumult.

One must learn first to know himself before knowing anything else (γνῶθι σε αυτόν). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of the irksome, sinister traveling companion―that irony of life which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates), just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, \"After all, things cannot be otherwise,\" only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As in the case of a man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito). Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here. Just as no one who has been taught a great deal about swimming is able to keep afloat in a storm, but only the man who is intensely convinced and has experiences that he is actually lighter than water, so a person who lacks this inward point of poise is unable to keep afloat in life's storms.―Only when a man has understood himself in this way is he able to maintain an independent existence and thus avoid surrendering his own I.

It begins with the teaching about sin. The category of sin is the category of individuality. Sin cannot be thought speculativelyat all. The individual human being lies beneath the concept; an individual human being cannot be thought, but only the concept \"man.\" —That is why speculation promptly embarks upon the teaching about the predominance of the generation over the individual, for it is too much to expect that speculation should acknowledge the impotence of the concept in relation to actuality. —But just as one individual person cannot be thought, neither can one individual sinner; sin can be thought (then it becomes negation), but not one individual sinner. That is precisely why there is no earnestness about sin if it is only to be thought, for earnestness is simply this: that you and I are sinners. Earnestness is not sin in general; rather, the accent of earnestness rests on the sinner, who is the single individual. With respect to \"the single individual,\" speculation, if it is consistent, must make light of being a single individual or being that which cannot be thought. If it cares to do anything along this line, it must say to the individual: Is this anything to waste your time on? Forget it! To be an individual human being is to be nothing! Think—then you are all mankind: cogito ergo sum [I think therefore I am]. But perhaps that is a lie; perhaps instead the single individual human being and to be a single human being are the highest. Just suppose it is. To be completely consistent, then, speculation must also say: To be an individual sinner is not to be something; it lies beneath the concept; do not waste any time on it etc. [. . .] Sin is a qualification of the single individual; it is irresponsibility and new sin to pretend as if it were nothing to be an individual sinner—when one himself is this individual sinner. Here Christianity steps in, makes the sign of the cross before speculation; it is just as impossible for speculation to get around this issue as for a sailing vessel to sail directly against a contrary wind. The earnestness of sin is its actuality in the single individual, be it you or I. Speculatively, we are supposed to look away from the single individual; therefore, speculatively, we can speak only superficially about sin.

Se se não possuísse outra resposta, de forma alguma acharia ter de rejeitar esta pergunta, pretextando a sua falta de senso; porque, no abstrato, em presença de um favor, todos temos mesmos direitos. São esquecidos a tribulação, a angústia, o paradoxo. Meu pensamento é tão puro como o de qualquer outro; e ele purifica-se, exercendo-se sobre as coisas. E se não se enobrecer pode-se então esperar pelo espanto; porque se essas imagens foram alguma vez evocadas jamais poderão ser esquecidas. E se contra elasse peca, extraem da sua muda cólera uma terrível vingança, mais terrível do que os rugidos de dez ferozes críticos. Maria,indubitavelmente, deu à luz o filho graças a um milagre, mas no decorrer de tal acontecimento foi como todas as outras mulheres, e esse tempo é o da angústia, da tribulação e do paradoxo. O anjo foi,sem dúvida, um espírito caritativo, mas não foi complacente porque não foi dizer a todas as outras virgens de Israel: Não desprezeis Maria, porque lhe sucedeu o extraordinário. Apresentou-se perante ela só e ninguém a pôde compreender. No entanto, que outra mulher foi mais ofendida do que Maria? Pois não é também verdade que aquele a quem Deus abençoa é também amaldiçoado com o mesmo sopro do seu espírito? É desta forma que se torna necessário, espiritualmente,compreender Maria. Ela não é, de maneira alguma, uma formosa dama que brinca com um deus menino, e até me sinto revoltado ao dizer isto e muito mais ao pensar na afetação e ligeireza de tal concepção. Apesar disso, quando diz: sou a serva do Senhor, ela é grande e imagino que não deve ser difícil explicar por que razão se tornou mãe de Deus. Não precisa, absolutamente nada, da admiração do mundo, tal como Abraão não necessita de lágrimas,porque nem ela foi uma heroína, nem ele foi um herói. E não se tornaram grandes por terem escapado à tribulação, ao desespero e ao paradoxo, mas precisamente porque sofreram tudo isso. Há grandeza em ouvir dizer ao poeta, quando apresenta o seu herói trágico à admiração dos homens: chorai por ele; merece-o; porque é grandioso merecer as lágrimas dos que são dignos de as derramar;há grandeza em ver o poeta conter a multidão, corrigir os homens e analisá-los um por um para verificar se são dignos de chorar pelo herói, porque as lágrimas dos vulgares chorões profanam o sagrado.Contudo ainda é mais grandioso que o cavaleiro da fé possa dizer ao nobre caráter que quer chorar por ele: não chores por mim, chora antes por ti próprio."},{"id":1092,"quote":"... when the ambitious man whose slogan is 'Either Caesar or nothing' does not get to be Caesar, he despairs over it.

I have sought to appropriate much from them, studied their distinctive characteristics and meaning in human life, but at the same time guarded against coming, like the moth, too close to the flame. I have had little to win or to lose in association with the ordinary run of men, partly because what they do―so-called practical life―does not interest me much, partly because their coldness and indifference to the spiritual and deeper currents in man alienate me even more from them. With few exceptions my companions have had no special influence upon me. A life that has not arrived at clarity about itself must necessarily exhibit an uneven side-surface; confronted by certain facts [*Facta*] and their apparent disharmony, they simply halted there, for, as I see it, they did not have sufficient interest to seek a resolution in a higher harmony or to recognize the necessity of it. Their opinion of me was always one-sided, and I have vacillated between putting too much or too little weight on what they said. I have now withdrawn from their influence and the potential variations of my life's compass resulting from it. Thus I am again standing at the point where I must begin again in another way. I shall now calmly attempt to look at myself and begin to initiate inner action; for only thus will I be able, like a child calling itself \"I\" in its first consciously undertaken act, be able to call myself \"I\" in a profounder sense.But that takes stamina, and it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown.

So let the die be cast―I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past―why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper.

Sorrow has the opposite movement to that of pain. So long as one doesn't spoil things out of a misplaced mania for consistency―something I shall prevent also in another way―one may say: the more innocence, the deeper the sorrow. If you press this too far, you destroy the tragic. There is always an element of guilt left over, but it is never properly reflected in the subject; which is why in Greek tragedy the sorrow is so deep. In order to prevent misplaced consistency, I shall merely remark that exaggeration only succeeds in carrying the matter over into another sphere. The synthesis of absolute innocence and absolute guilt is not an aesthetic feature but a metaphysical one. This is the real reason why people have always been ashamed to call the life of Christ a tragedy; one feels instinctively that aesthetic categories do not exhaust the matter. It is clear in another way, too that Christ's life amounts to more than can be exhausted in aesthetic terms, namely from the fact that these terms neutralize themselves in this phenomenon, and are rendered irrelevant. Tragic action always contains an element of suffering, and tragic suffering an element of action; the aesthetic lies in the relativity. The identity of an absolute action and an absolute suffering is beyond the powers of aesthetics and belongs to metaphysics. This identity is exemplified in the life of Christ, for His suffering is absolute because the action is absolutely free, and His action is absolute suffering because it is absolute obedience. The element of guilt that is always left over is, accordingly, not subjectively reflected and this makes the sorrow deep. Tragic guilt is more than just subjective guilt, it is inherited guilt. But inherited guilt, like original sin, is a substantial category, and it is just this substantiality that makes the sorrow deeper. Sophocles' celebrated tragic trilogy, *Oedipus at Colonus*, *Oedipus Rex*, and *Antigone*, turns essentially on this authentic tragic interest. But inherited guilt contains the self-contradiction of being guilt yet not being guilt. The bond that makes the individual guilty is precisely piety, but the guilt which he thereby incurs has all possible aesthetic ambiguity. One might well conclude that the people who developed profound tragedy were the Jews. Thus, when they say of Jehova that he is a jealous God who visits the sins of the fathers on the children unto the third and fourth generations, or one hears those terrible imprecations in the Old Testament, one might feel tempted to look here for the material of tragedy. But Judaism is too ethically developed for this. Jehova's curses, terrible as they are, are nevertheless also righteous punishment. Such was not the case in Greece, there the wrath of the gods has no ethical, but aesthetic ambiguity\" (Either/Or)."},{"id":1265,"quote":"Surrounded by hordes of people, busy with all sorts of secular matters, more and more shrewd about the ways of the world – such a person forgets himself, forgets his name divinely understood, does not dare to believe in himself, finds it too risky to be himself, far easier and safer to be like the others, to become a copy, a number, part of the crowd."},{"id":1266,"quote":"Mine’: what does this word mean?

How remarkable that one of the writers on bees - yes, the best of them - was blind from early youth; it's as if to show that here, where you would have thought external observation so important, he had found that point and from it was then able by purely mental activity to infer back to all particulars and reconstruct them in analogy with nature."},{"id":1305,"quote":"The thought of death gives the earnest person the right momentum in life and the right goal toward which he directs his momentum"},{"id":1306,"quote":"Kazna odgovara krivici: da nam bude uskraćeno svako zadovoljstvoživljenja, da smo dovedeni do najvišeg stepena odvratnosti prema životu."},{"id":1307,"quote":"آه ايّوب! آه! ای ايّوب! آيا براستی تو چيزی به غير از اين كلمات زيبا بر زبان نياوردی: خداوند داد و خداوند گرفت: و نام خداوند متبرك باد؟ آيا اين‌ها تنها كلماتی بود كه بر زبان آوردی؟ با تمام درد و عذابی كه كشيدی فقط همين‌ها را تكرار كردی؟ چرا هفت روز و هفت شب خاموش ماندی، در روحت آخر چه می‌گذشت؟ هنگامی كه تمام هستی بر سرت خراب شد و همچو تكه‌های سفالی شكسته در اطراف پاهايت پخش‌و‌پلا شد، آيا بلافاصله به اين شكل فوق بشری بر خود مسلط گشتی، آيا بلافاصله به اين تعبير از عشق دست يافتی، به اين پُردلی برخاسته از ايمان و اعتماد؟..."},{"id":1308,"quote":"La hora del dolor puede volvernos altivos, si es que no nos quiebra: en ella, nada se ha quebrado…"}]
