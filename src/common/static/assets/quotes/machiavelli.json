And so (on the contrary), good institutions without the help of the military are not much differently disordered than the habitation of a superb and regal palace, which, even though adorned with jewels and gold, if it is not roofed over will not have anything to protect it from the rain. And, if in any other institutions of a City and of a Republic every diligence is employed in keeping men loyal, peaceful, and full of the fear of God, it is doubled in the military; for in what man ought the country look for greater loyalty than in that man who has to promise to die for her?

The answer is that one would prefer to be both but, since they don’t go together easily, if you have to choose, it’s much safer to be feared than loved. We can say this of most people: that they are ungrateful and unreliable; they lie, they fake, they’re greedy for cash and they melt away in the face of danger. So long as you’re generous and, as I said before, not in immediate danger, they’re all on your side: they’d shed their blood for you, they’d give you their belongings, their lives, their children. But when you need them they turn their backs on you. The ruler who has relied entirely on their promises and taken no other precautions is lost. Friendship that comes at a price, and not because people admire your spirit and achievements, may indeed have been paid for, but that doesn’t mean you really possess it and you certainly won’t be able to count on it when you need it. Men are less worried about letting down someone who has made himself loved than someone who makes himself feared. Love binds when someone recognizes he should be grateful to you, but, since men are a sad lot, gratitude is forgotten the moment it’s inconvenient. Fear means fear of punishment, and that’s something people never forget."},{"id":889,"quote":"All the same, while a ruler can’t expect to inspire love when making himself feared, he must avoid arousing hatred. Actually, being feared is perfectly compatible with not being hated. And a ruler won’t be hated if he keeps his hands off his subjects’ property and their women. If he really has to have someone executed, he should only do it when he has proper justification and manifest cause. Above all, he mustn’t seize other people’s property. A man will sooner forget the death of his father than the loss of his inheritance. Of course there are always reasons for taking people’s property and a ruler who has started to live that way will never be short of pretexts for grabbing more.

Hence a sensible leader cannot and must not keep his word if by doing so he puts himself at risk, and if the reasons that made him give his word in the first place are no longer valid. If all men were good, this would be bad advice, but since they are a sad lot and won’t be keeping their promises to you, you hardly need to keep yours to them. Anyway, a ruler will never be short of good reasons to explain away a broken promise. It would be easy to cite any number of examples from modern times to show just how many peace treaties and other commitments have been rendered null and void by rulers not keeping their word.

I’ll go so far as to say this: if he had those qualities and observed them all the time, he’d be putting himself at risk. It’s seeming to be virtuous that helps; as, for example, seeming to be compassionate, loyal, humane, honest and religious. And you can even be those things, so long as you’re always mentally prepared to change as soon as your interests are threatened. What you have to understand is that a ruler, especially a ruler new to power, can’t always behave in ways that would make people think a man good, because to stay in power he’s frequently obliged to act against loyalty, against charity, against humanity and against religion. What matters is that he has the sort of character that can change tack as luck and circumstances demand, and, as I’ve already said, stick to the good if he can but know how to be bad when the occasion demands. So a ruler must be extremely careful not to say anything that doesn’t appear to be inspired by the five virtues listed above; he must seem and sound wholly compassionate, wholly loyal, wholly humane, wholly honest and wholly religious. There is nothing more important than appearing to be religious. In general people judge more by appearances than first-hand experience, because everyone gets to see you but hardly anyone deals with you directly. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few have experience of who you really are, and those few won’t have the courage to stand up to majority opinion underwritten by the authority of state"},{"id":907,"quote":"Por tanto, a un príncipe le es necesario saber utilizar correctamente a la bestia y al hombre.

El tener como preceptor a alguien mitad animal y mitad hombre no quiere decir otra cosa que un príncipe necesita saber usar una y otra naturaleza, y que la una no perdura sin la otra.Así pues, dado que el príncipe necesita saber usar correctamente a la bestia, debe elegir de entre ellas a la zorra y al león, porque el león no sabe defenderse de las trampas ni la zorra de los lobos. Necesita, pues, ser zorra para reconocer las trampas y león para asustar a los lobos. Los que sólo imitan al león no saben lo que hacen.

For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful. Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already.

Los Estados bien organizados y los príncipes sabios siempre han procurado no exasperar a los nobles y, a la vez, tener satisfecho y contento al pueblo. Es este uno de los puntos a que más debe atender un príncipe. (p. 33)Sólo quien sea capaz de cortar, como suele decirse, un cabello en el aire, podrá hallar alguna diferencia entre “excusa y “justificación”. (p. 50)Sucede lo que los médicos dicen del tísico: que al principio su mal es difícil de conocer, pero fácil de curar, mientras que, con el transcurso del tiempo, al no haber sido conocido ni atajado, se vuelve fácil de conocer, pero difícil de curar. (p. 4)Como quiera que haya sido, lo cierto es que nadie probablemente ha sido, tanto como Maquiavelo, signo de contradicción. Nadie ha tenido tan varia y tempestuosa fortuna, como suelen decir los italianos; y vale recordar algunas por lo menos de sus más sonadas peripecias. (p. 11)Maquiavelo puede pasar casi como un santo. Que una u otra vez sacrificó en los altares de Afrodita (de la Pandemia siempre, porque fue varón a carta cabal), parece ser lo más probable pero fueron pasiones o pasioncillas que no alteraron la paz de su hogar, ni sobrepusieron en modo alguno (la carta a Vettori lo está diciendo) a su labor intelectual. (p. 25)… y si no perseveró más en el género dramático -un entretenimiento para él, en fin de cuentas- fue por la simple razón de que lo que ante todo le absorbía era el homo politicus, o como él decía, el ragionar dello stato, y en esto hubo de consumirse lo mejor de su energía espiritual. (p. 11)En la concepción de Maquiavelo, el Príncipe es el Estado… En cuanto al pueblo, es algo que no ha podido definirse jamás. Como entidad política, es una entidad puramente abstracta. No se sabe exactamente ni dónde comienza ni dónde acaba. El adjetivo de soberano aplicado al pueblo es una farsa trágica… Al pueblo no le queda ni un monosílabo para afirmar y obedecer. (p. 15)En los Discursos sobre Tito Livio abundan declaraciones semejantes. “Hay que partir del presupuesto de que los hombres son todos perversos (tutti gli uomini rei), y que siempre que se les presente ocasión, harán uso de la malignidad de su ánimo… Los hombres no obran jamás el bien, a no ser por necesidad”. (p. 32)La libertad, por tanto, es para Maquiavelo el supremo bien a cuya consecución debe ordenarse la comunidad política, y por esta consideración censura severamente a Julio César, por haber sido el exterminador de las libertades públicas y, en suma, de la República romana. (p. 28)Ha de notarse, pues, que a los hombres hay que conquistarlos o eliminarlos, porque si se vengan de las ofensas leves, de las graves no pueden; así que la ofensa que se haga al hombre debe ser tal, que le resulte imposible vengarse. (p. 3)… no sin haberle colgado previamente una inscripción según la cual Maquiavelo habría sido un hombre astuto y pérfido, coadjutor de los demonios e incomparable artífice de maquinaciones diabólicas: “Homo vafer ac subdolus, diabolicarum cogitationum faber optimus, cacodaemonis auxiliator”. (p. 12)Quien confía en el pueblo edifica sobre arena. (se me olvidó colocar la página)Y Traiano Boccalini, por su parte, decía lo siguiente: “No vemos por qué ha de condenarse la lectura de Maquiavelo, cuando se recomienda la lectura de la Historia”. (p. 38)… en esto acabó por convertirse, según dice Macaulay, el odiado político florentino.

(p. 15)Lo que no depende de la poca o mucha virtud del conquistador, sino de la naturaleza de lo conquistado.

(p. 11)Sin embargo, el que menos ha confiado en el azar es siempre el que más tiempo se ha conservado en su conquista. También facilita enormemente las cosas el que un príncipe, al no poseer otros Estados, se vea obligado a establecerse en el que ha adquirido. Pero quiero referirme a aquellos que no se convirtieron en príncipes por el azar, sino por sus virtudes. Y digo entonces que, entre ellos, los más ilustres han sido Moisés, Ciro, Rómulo, Teseo y otros no menos grandes. Y aunque Moisés sólo fue un simple agente de la voluntad de Dios, merece, sin embargo, nuestra admiración, siquiera sea por la gracia que lo hacía digno de hablar con Dios. Pero también son admirables Ciro, y todos los demás que han adquirido o fundado reinos; y si juzgamos sus hechos y su gobierno, hallaremos que no deslucen ante los de Moisés, que tuvo tan gran preceptor. Y si nos detenemos a estudiar su vida y sus obras, descubriremos que no deben a la fortuna sino el haberles proporcionado la ocasión propicia, que fue el material al que ellos dieron la forma conveniente. Verdad es que, sin esa ocasión, sus méritos de nada hubieran valido; pero también es cierto que, sin sus méritos, era inútil que la ocasión se presentará. (pp. 9-10)Pero volvamos a nuestro asunto. Cualquiera que meditase este discurso hallaría que la causa de la ruina de los emperadores citados ha sido el odio o el desprecio, y descubriría a qué se debe que, mientras parte de ellos procedieron de un modo y parte de otro, en ambos hubo dichosos y desgraciados.

It would be so easy to write the English cognate ‘virtue’, meaning the opposite of vice, but this is not what Machiavelli was talking about. He was not interested in the polarity ‘good’/‘evil’, but in winning and losing, strength and weakness, success and failure. For Machiavelli ‘virtù’ was any quality of character that enabled you to take political power or to hold on to it; in short, a winning trait. It could be courage in battle, or strength of personality, or political cunning, or it might even be the kind of ruthless cruelty that lets your subjects know you mean business. But one can hardly write ‘cunning’ or ‘cruelty’ for ‘virtù’, even if one knows that in this context that is what the text means; because then you would lose the sense that although Machiavelli is not talking about the moral virtues he nevertheless wants to give a positive connotation to the particular qualities he is talking about: this cruelty is aimed at solving problems, retaining power, keeping a state strong, hence, in this context it is a ‘virtù’. Ugly though it may sound, then, I have sometimes been obliged to translate ‘virtù’ as ‘positive qualities’ or ‘strength of character’, except of course on those occasions - because there are some - when Machiavelli does mean ‘virtues’ in the moral sense: in which case he’s usually talking about the importance of faking them even if you may not have them"},{"id":1093,"quote":"Todos ven lo que pareces ser, mas pocos saben lo que eres."},{"id":1094,"quote":"Es esa perspectiva realista la que le obliga a concluir que un príncipe no debe actuar de forma invariable, siempre guiado por unos principios morales inamovibles e idénticos para cualquier situación, más bien debe tener como único principio conseguir el beneficio de su Estado como un todo mediante la eliminación de la corrupción del sistema, aunque para ello tenga que usar «hipócritamente» la religión o conculcar sus preceptos cuando lo exija la situación."},{"id":1095,"quote":"In the end it will be necessary, if he wants to maintain a name for liberality, to burden the people extraordinarily, to be rigorous with taxes, and to do all those things that can be done to get money.

I think it’s a question of whether cruelty is well or badly used. Cruelty well used (if we can ever speak well of something bad) is short-lived and decisive, no more than is necessary to secure your position and then stop; you don’t go on being cruel but use the power it has given you to deliver maximum benefits to your subjects. Cruelty is badly used when you’re not drastic enough at the beginning but grow increasingly cruel later on, rather than easing off. A leader who takes the first approach has a chance, like Agathocles, of improving his position with his subjects and with God too; go the other way and you have no chance at all. It’s worth noting that when you take hold of a state, you must assess how much violence and cruelty will be necessary and get it over with at once, so as not to have to be cruel on a regular basis. When you’ve stopped using violence your subjects will be reassured and you can then win them over with generosity. If you don’t do all it takes at the beginning, because you were badly advised or didn’t have the nerve, then you’ll always have to be wielding the knife; and you’ll never be able to count on your subjects, since with all the violence you’re handing out they won’t be able to count on you. So get the violence over with as soon as possible; that way there’ll be less time for people to taste its bitterness and they’ll be less hostile. Favours, on the other hand, should be given out slowly, one by one, so that they can be properly savoured. Most of all, though, a ruler should have the kind of relationship with his subjects where nothing that can happen, good or bad, will force him to change his approach, because if hard times demand it, your cruelty will come too late, while any concessions you make will be seen as wrung out of you and no one will be impressed. 9 Monarchy with public support Now let’s turn to our second case, where a private citizen becomes king in his own country not by crime or unacceptable violence, but with the support of his fellow-citizens. We can call this a monarchy with public support and to become its king you don’t have to be wholly brilliant or extraordinarily lucky, just shrewd in a lucky way. Obviously, to take control of this kind of state you need the support of either the common people or the wealthy families, the nobles.

Fuera de esta solución tan querida por el pensamiento político cristiano, la cualidad de legítimo sólo puede provenir del colectivo social afectado, cosa que para el florentino sucede cuando la virtú del príncipe produce los efectos deseados: la estabilidad y la paz social que se manifiesta en la aceptación del sistema de poder. Para ello son decisivas las buenas instituciones políticas y las buenas leyes. Ahora bien, muchas veces el príncipe ha de tomar decisiones impopulares que parecen vicio aunque sean virtud, de ahí que precise controlar su imagen pública y «ser un gran simulador y disimulador» capaz de evitar ser despreciado y odiado24.Aquí se encuentra una de las principales aportaciones de Maquiavelo a la filosofía política moderna, pues esta idea es el núcleo de la teoría de la legitimación indirecta. Desde la perspectiva inmanente aquí adoptada, el problema no es si una dominación es en sí misma legítima o no, sino por qué medios una dominación puede legitimarse y así autoconservarse.

The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were."},{"id":1138,"quote":"Kişinin nasıl yaşadığı ve nasıl yaşaması gerektiği arasında öyle büyük bir uçurum vardır ki, yapılması gereken uğruna yapılanı terk eden kişi, çok geçmeden korunmasını değil, yıkımını öğrenmiş olur."},{"id":1139,"quote":"Así pasa en las cosas del Estado: los males que nacen en él, cuando se los descubre a tiempo, lo que sólo es dado al hombre sagaz, se los cura pronto; pero ya no tienen remedio cuando, por no haberlos advertido, se los deja crecer hasta el punto de que todo el mundo los ve."},{"id":1140,"quote":"Los medios que ofrece son de características bien distintas: la religión, rodearse de personas de talento, usar sicarios para las tareas impopulares, llevar a cabo empresasgrandes y vistosas, etc. En cualquier caso es imprescindible la seducción por la apariencia, aunque implique manipulación de la realidad y de la opinión de los súbditos.
