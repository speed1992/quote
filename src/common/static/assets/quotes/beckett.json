Perhaps the name was Edith. She had a hole between her legs, oh not the bunghole I had always imagined, but a slit, and in this I put, or rather she put, my so-called virile member, not without difficulty, and I toiled and moiled until I discharged or gave up trying or was begged by her to stop. A mug's game in my opinion and tiring on top of that, in the long run. But I lent myself to it with a good enough grace, knowing it was love, for she had told me so. She bent over the couch, because of her rheumatism, and in I went from behind. It was the only position she could bear, because of her lumbago. It seemed all right to me, for I had seen dogs, and I was astonished when she confided that you could go about it differently. I wonder what she meant exactly. Perhaps after all she put me in her rectum. A matter of complete indifference to me, I needn't tell you. But is it true love, in the rectum? That's what bothers me sometimes. Have I never known true love, after all? She too was an eminently flat woman and she moved with short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick. Perhaps she too was a man, yet another of them. But in that case surely our testicles would have collided, while we writhed. Perhaps she held hers tight in her hand, on purpose to avoid it. She favoured voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and other undergarments whose names I forget. They welled up all frothing and swishing and then, congress achieved, broke over us in slow cascades. And all I could see was her taut yellow nape which every now and then I set my teeth in, forgetting I had none, such is the power of instinct. We met in a rubbish dump, unlike any other, and yet they are all alike, rubbish dumps. I don't know what she was doing there. I was limply poking about in the garbage saying probably, for at that age I must still have been capable of general ideas, This is life. She had no time to lose, I had nothing to lose, I would have made love with a goat, to know what love was. She had a dainty flat, no, not dainty, it made you want to lie down in a corner and never get up again. I liked it. It was full of dainty furniture, under our desperate strokes the couch moved forward on its castors, the whole place fell about our ears, it was pandemonium. Our commerce was not without tenderness, with trembling hands she cut my toe-nails and I rubbed her rump with winter cream. This idyll was of short duration. Poor Edith, I hastened her end perhaps. Anyway it was she who started it, in the rubbish dump, when she laid her hand upon my fly. More precisely, I was bent double over a heap of muck, in the hope of finding something to disgust me for ever with eating, when she, undertaking me from behind, thrust her stick between my legs and began to titillate my privates. She gave me money after each session, to me who would have consented to know love, and probe it to the bottom, without charge. But she was an idealist. I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice less arid and roomy, that would have given me a higher opinion of love it seems to me. However. Twixt finger and thumb tis heaven in comparison. But love is no doubt above such contingencies. And not when you are comfortable, but when your frantic member casts about for a rubbing-place, and the unction of a little mucous membrane, and meeting with none does not beat in retreat, but retains its tumefaction, it is then no doubt that true love comes to pass, and wings away, high above the tight fit and the loose."},{"id":376,"quote":"Astride of a grave and a difficult birth.Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on the forceps.We have time to grow old.The air is full of our cries.But habit is a great deadener.At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying, He is sleeping, he knows nothing.Let him sleep on."},{"id":377,"quote":"Dying for dark - the darker the worse.

Or that one may be separated from the orther? Or that both may be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each may be taken up in turn and considered apart from the other?”Here form is content, content is form. You complain that this stuff is not written in English. It is not written at all.

They were pebbles but I call them stones. Yes, on this occasion I laid in a considerable store. I distributed them equally between my four pockets, and sucked them turn and turn about. This raised a problem which I first solved in the following way. I had say sixteen stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat. Taking a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it. Thus there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not quite the same stones. And when the desire to suck took hold of me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain of not taking the same stone as the last time. And while I sucked it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described. And so on. But this solution did not satisfy me fully. For it did not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones circulating thus might always be the same four. In which case, far from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about. But I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket. But this was only a makeshift that could not long content a man like me. So I began to look for something else."},{"id":756,"quote":"No matter, no matter how, they are doing the best they can, with the miserable means at their disposal, a voice, a little light, poor devils, that's what they're paid for, they say, No sign of hardening, no sign of softening, impossible to say, no matter, it's a good average, we only have to continue, one day he'll understand, one day he'll thrill, the little spasm will come, a change in the eye, and cast him up among us.

For to be out of one and not out of the other was for cleverer than me, who was not clever, but foolish. But I may be quite wrong. And these different windows that open in my head, when I grope again among those days, really existed perhaps and perhaps do still, in spite of my being no longer there, I mean there looking at them, opening them and shutting them, or crouched in a corner of the room marvelling at the things they framed."},{"id":859,"quote":"Can it be out of discretion, and a reluctance to hurt, that they affect to be unaware of my existence?

Geriye yalnızca dayanaklar bulmak, bunları yalanlamaya çalışan bütün öteki unsurları ortadan kaldırmak kalıyordu. Zor ama keyifli bir işti. Koğuşlarda geçen her saat, hastalara duyduğu saygıyı ve sağlıklı bir aklın göstergesini dış gerçeklikle kurulan ilişkiye bağlayan sahte bilimsel yaklaşıma duyduğu tiksintiyi artırıyordu zorunlu olarak. Her geçen saat artırıyordu. Dış gerçekliğin doğası anlaşılmaz kalıyordu. Bilimin erkekleri, kadınları ve çocukları veriler önünde boyunlarını bükmek zorunda kalıyordu, ister istemez. Dış gerçekliğin ya da kısacası gerçekliğin tanımı, tanımlayanın duyarlılığına göre değişiyordu. Ama hepsi, bu gerçeklikle temasa geçmenin, temas ne kadar üstünkörü olursa olsun, ender görülen bir ayrıcalık olduğunda birleşir duumdaydı. Bu anlayışın ışığında hastalar gerçeklikten, ortalama birinin gerçekliğinden, ağır vakalarda gözlemlendiği gibi bütünüyle olmasa da en azından bazı temel noktalarda “kopmuş olarak tanımlanıyorlardı. Tedavinin işlevi hastayı kendi küçük, özel çöplüğünden çıkarıp muhteşem dünyanın merak, sevgi, nefret, tutku, sevinme, ağlama gibi farklı unsurlarıyla, paha biçilmez ayrıcalığına yeniden kavuşacağı ve kendisinden hiç de farklı olmayan ötekilerle akılcı ve dengeli biçimde avunacağı duruma getirmek ve aradaki uçurumu kapamaktı. Ama bütün bunlar, psikiyatrların sürgün diye tanımladığı bedensel ve ussal deneyimi barınak; iyiliksever bir dizgedan kovulmuş olarak değerlendiren, hastalığı da müthiş bir fiyaskodan kaçmış kişiler olarak gören Murphy'yi çileden çıkarıyordu. Eğer aklı günlük olayları yorulmak bilmeyen bir araç gibi alt alta yazıp toplayan şaşmaz bir yazarkasa olsa, o zaman kuşkusuz aklın yitimine üzüntü duyabilirdi. Ama böyle olmadığına göre, aklı diye adlandırdığı şey bir araçtan çok, içinden kendinin soyutlanmış olduğu günlük olayların bir izdüşümü biçiminde ortaya çıktığına göre aklın yok oluşunu, zincirlerinden kurtulmayla özdeşleştirip alkışlamasından daha doğal ne olabilirdi?Murphy'nin saplantısının basitleştirdiği ve çarpıttığı çelişki o halde büyük dünyayla küçük dünyayı temelde karşı karşıya getiriyordu. Hastaların etkisiyle ikincisini, psikiyatrların zorlaması ile ilkini yeğleme arasında kararsızca dolanıyordu. Kararsızlık yalnızca olgular düzlemindeydı. Yalnızca olgular. Seçimini yapmıştı o. \"Ben büyük dünyadan değilim, küçük dünyadanım\" nakaratı Murphy için epey eskilere dayanıyordu ve olumsuz bir inanca, daha doğrusu olumsuz iki inanca dönüşmüştü. Bir kere mağarasının mutlu manzaralarını gördükten sonra bırakın bunları geliştirip işlemeyi, fiyaskolara nasıl dayanabilirdi? Arnold Geulincx’in güzelim Latincesiyle söylediği gibi: Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis. Ama hiçbir değer taşımadığı bir yerde, hiçbir şey istememesi yeterli olmuyordu, bir adım daha atıp yalnızca kendisini sevebilecek bir ussal aşkın dışında kalan her şeyi yadsıması da yeterli olmuyordu çünkü sevilecek başka yanı yoktu. Bu hiçbir zaman yeterli olmamıştı ve yeterli olabileceğine ilişkin hiçbir belirti göstermiyordu. Bu özellikler ve öteki ikinci derecede önemli şeyler, maddesel düzlemde destek bulsalar (örneğin sallanan iskemle) ve kendileri için her yönde baskı yapsalar da istenen kararın kesinleşmesini başaramazlardı. Parçalanmışlığı sürüyordu; Celia'ya, baharatlı ekmeğe ve benzeri şeylere duyduğu zayıflık bunun göstergesiydi. Tek parçada bütünleşme olanaklarından yoksundu.”"},{"id":964,"quote":"What goes by the name of love is banishment, with now and then a postcard from the homeland."},{"id":965,"quote":"Şu uğursuz zaman hikayelerinizle bana yeteri kadar işkence yapmadınız mı?

Bo same na swój sposób będąc rodzajem skóry, jeżeli się pominie ich płyny i powieki, mają więcej niż tylko jednego przeciwnika. Wysuszenie powłoki odbiera nagości wdzięk, zmienia różowość w szarość i sprawia, że ciała miast plaskać, gdy się ze sobą ścierają, szeleszczą jak pokrzywy.

Атож, цього разу я зробив великий запас. Я рівномірно розподілив їх по своїх чотирьох кишенях і смоктав по черзі. Це становило проблему, яку я спершу розв'язав наступним способом. Я розклав шістнадцять камінців, отже, поклав по чотири до кожної з моїх чотирьох кишень, двох кишень штанів і двох кишень плаща. Беручи камінець у правій кишені плаща, я клав його до рота й заміняв його в правій кишені плаща камінчиком з правої кишені штанів, заміняючи його камінчиком з лівої кишені штанів, а вже той я заміняв камінчиком з лівої кишені плаща, заміняючи його камінчиком, що був у роті, тільки-но припинивши смоктати його. Таким чином у кожній з моїх чотирьох кишень завжди було по чотири камінці, та аж ніяк не ті самі. А коли знову відчував бажання смоктати, сягав рукою в праву кишеню плаща, впевнений, що беру не той самий камінчик, що й минулого разу. А смокчучи, перекладав решту камінців, як уже пояснював вам. І так далі. Але цей розв'язок задовольняв мене тільки наполовину. Адже я не міг не подумати, що внаслідок надзвичайної випадковости могло статися так, що циркулюють завжди ті самі чотири камінці. В такому випадку, замість смоктати по черзі шістнадцять камінців, я насправді смоктав лише чотири, по черзі, але завжди ті самі. [...] Тож я став шукати інших варіантів. [...] Не переповідаючи всіх етапів та мук, крізь які я пройшов, перше ніж натрапити на розв'язок, я опишу його, свій розв'язок, в усій його огидності. Він полягав лише (лише!) в тому, щоб покласти на початку, скажімо, шість камінців до правої кишені плаща, бо саме з цієї кишені я завжди брав камінчики до рота, п'ять камінців до правої кишені штанів і, нарешті, п'ять камінців до лівої кишені штанів, і це становило, двічі по п'ять плюс шість, шістнадцять, і жодного камінця, бо вже не лишалося жодного, не було в лівій кишені плаща, яка поки що лишалася порожньою, зрозуміло, що порожньою від камінців, бо там були речі, які постійно лежали в тій кишені, а також предмети, які перебували там тимчасово. Адже де, по-вашому, я ховав свій ніж, столове срібло, клаксон і все інше, чого я ще не називав і чого, можливо, не назву ніколи? Гаразд. Тепер я можу почати смоктати. Стежте уважно. Я беру один камінчик у правій кишені плаща, смокчу його, вже не смокчу його і кладу до лівої, порожньої (від камінців) кишені плаща. Потій беру другий камінчик у правій кишені плаща, смокчу його і кладу до лівої кишені плаща. І так далі, аж поки права кишеня мого плаща спорожніє (окрім від предметів, які постійно й тимчасово перебували в ній), а всі шість камінців, обсмоктані, один за одним перейшли до лівої кишені плаща. Далі я зупинявся й зосереджувався, бо ж ішлося про те, щоб не скоїти якоїсь дурниці, й перекладав до правої кишені плаща, де вже не було камінців, п'ять камінців з правої кишені штанів, на їхнє місце я клав п'ять камінців з лівої кишені штанів, а на їхнє місце — шість камінців з лівої кишені плаща. І ось уже в лівій кишені плаща знову немає камінців, натомість права кишеня плаща знову наповнена, і то бездоганно, тобто іншими камінцями, ніж ті, які я смоктав, і тепер я вже їх починаю смоктати, одного за одним, і поступово перекладати до лівої кишені плаща, впевнений, тією мірою, якою можна мати впевненість у таких речах, що смокчу не ті камінці, які щойно смоктав, а інші. А коли права кишеня плаща знову стає порожня (від камінців), а п'ять камінців, теж уже обсмоктані, всі без винятку опиняються в лівій кишені плаща, тоді я вдаюся до такого самого перерозподілу, який відбувався перед тим, або ж до аналогічного перерозподілу, тобто перекладаю до правої кишені плаща, якою знову можна користатися, п'ять камінців з правої кишені штанів, на їхнє місце я кладу шість камінців з лівої кишені штанів, а на їхнє місце — п'ять камінців з лівої кишені плаща."},{"id":1046,"quote":"Dünyadaki gözyaşı miktarı sa­bittir.
