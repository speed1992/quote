Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent, and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits; and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence of her virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent in courage and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.

Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain.

And I felt quite proud, thinking that I knew the nature of true praise, and should speak well. Whereas I now see that the intention was to attribute to Love every species of greatness and glory, whether really belonging to him or not, without regard to truth or falsehood—that was no matter; for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you should really praise Love, but only that you should appear to praise him. And so you attribute to Love every imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you say that 'he is all this,' and 'the cause of all that,' making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannot impose upon those who know him. And a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed. But as I misunderstood the nature of the praise when I said that I would take my turn, I must beg to be absolved from the promise which I made in ignorance, and which (as Euripides would say (Eurip. Hyppolytus)) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind. Farewell then to such a strain: for I do not praise in that way; no, indeed, I cannot. But if you like to hear the truth about love, I am ready to speak in my own manner, though I will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you.

Every circle, of those which are by the act of man drawn or even turned on a lathe, is full of that which is opposite to the fifth thing. For everywhere it has contact with the straight. But the circle itself, we say, has nothing in either smaller or greater, of that which is its opposite. We say also that the name is not a thing of permanence for any of them, and that nothing prevents the things now called round from being called straight, and the straight things round; for those who make changes and call things by opposite names, nothing will be less permanent (than a name). Again with regard to the definition, if it is made up of names and verbal forms, the same remark holds that there is no sufficiently durable permanence in it. And there is no end to the instances of the ambiguity from which each of the four suffers; but the greatest of them is that which we mentioned a little earlier, that, whereas there are two things, that which has real being, and that which is only a quality, when the soul is seeking to know, not the quality, but the essence, each of the four, presenting to the soul by word and in act that which it is not seeking (i.e., the quality), a thing open to refutation by the senses, being merely the thing presented to the soul in each particular case whether by statement or the act of showing, fills, one may say, every man with puzzlement and perplexity.[...] But in subjects where we try to compel a man to give a clear answer about the fifth, any one of those who are capable of overthrowing an antagonist gets the better of us, and makes the man, who gives an exposition in speech or writing or in replies to questions, appear to most of his hearers to know nothing of the things on which he is attempting to write or speak; for they are sometimes not aware that it is not the mind of the writer or speaker which is proved to be at fault, but the defective nature of each of the four instruments. The process however of dealing with all of these, as the mind moves up and down to each in turn, does after much effort give birth in a well-constituted mind to knowledge of that which is well constituted. [...] Therefore, if men are not by nature kinship allied to justice and all other things that are honourable, though they may be good at learning and remembering other knowledge of various kinds-or if they have the kinship but are slow learners and have no memory-none of all these will ever learn to the full the truth about virtue and vice. For both must be learnt together; and together also must be learnt, by complete and long continued study, as I said at the beginning, the true and the false about all that has real being. After much effort, as names, definitions, sights, and other data of sense, are brought into contact and friction one with another, in the course of scrutiny and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill will, with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem, and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of human powers. Therefore every man of worth, when dealing with matters of worth, will be far from exposing them to ill feeling and misunderstanding among men by committing them to writing. In one word, then, it may be known from this that, if one sees written treatises composed by anyone, either the laws of a lawgiver, or in any other form whatever, these are not for that man the things of most worth, if he is a man of worth, but that his treasures are laid up in the fairest spot that he possesses. But if these things were worked at by him as things of real worth, and committed to writing, then surely, not gods, but men \"have themselves bereft him of his wits\"."},{"id":1980,"quote":"Нали и за философа ще кажем, че той обича мъдростта, но не една или друга част от мъдростта, а цялата?"},{"id":1981,"quote":"SOCRATES: But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general.

Pongo por caso: el dirigir, el gobernar, el delibe­rar y todas las cosas de esta índole, podríamos atribuírse­las a algo que no sea el alma misma o diríamos que son propias de ésta?  De ella sólo.  ¿Y respecto de la vida? ¿No diremos que es operación del alma?  Sin duda  dijo.  ¿No diremos, pues, que existe una virtud propia del alma?  Lo diremos.  ¿Y acaso, oh Trasímaco, el alma realizará bien sus ope­raciones privada de su propia virtud o será ello imposible?  Imposible.  Fuerza será, por tanto, que el alma mala dirija y go­bierne mal y que la buena haga bien todas estas cosas.  Fuerza será.  ¿Y no convinimos en que la justicia era virtud del alma y la injusticia vicio?  En eso convinimos, en efecto.  Por tanto, el alma justa y el hombre justo vivirá bien; y el injusto mal.  Así aparece conforme a lo argumento  dijo.  Y, por otra parte, el que vive bien es feliz y dichoso, y el que vive mal, lo contrario.  ¿Cómo no?  Y así, el justo es dichoso; y el injusto, desgraciado.  Sea  dijo.  Por otro lado, no conviene ser desgraciado, sino di­choso.  ¿Qué duda tiene?  Por tanto, bendito Trasímaco, jamás es la injusticia más provechosa que la justicia.  Banquetéate con todo eso, ¡oh, Sócrates!, en las fies­tas Bendidias di dijo.  Banquete que tú me has preparado, ¡oh, Trasímaco!  observé yo , pues lo aplacaste conmigo y cesaste en lo enfado. Mezquino va a ser, sin embargo, no por lo culpa, sino por la mía; y es que, así como los golosos gustan siempre con arrebato del manjar que en cada momento se les sirve sin haber gozado debidamente del anterior, así me parece que yo, sin averiguar lo que primeramente considerábamos, qué cosa sea lo justo, me desprendí del asunto y me lancé a investigar acerca de ello, si era vicio e ignorancia o discreción y virtud; y presentándose luego un nuevo aserto, que la injusticia es más provechosa que la justicia, no me retraje de pasar a él, dejando el otro, de modo que ahora me acontece no saber nada como resul­tado de la discusión. Porque no sabiendo lo que es lo justo, difícil es que sepa si es virtud o no y si el que la po­see es desgraciado o dichoso."},{"id":2239,"quote":"anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of the beasts who are subject to man."},{"id":2240,"quote":"-Y lo que nos lleva al recuerdo de la desgracia y a las lamentaciones, sin saciarse nunca de ellas, ¿no diremos que es irracional y perezoso y allegado de la cobardía."}]
