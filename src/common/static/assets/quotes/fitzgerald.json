Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light. Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the FOLLIES. The party has begun."},{"id":924,"quote":"I don't want to sound like Pollyanna,\" she began, \"but you haven't grasped me yet.

And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes — a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.

We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.That’s my Middle West — not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.

Samo čekaj da vidiš.Vratio se u kućicu i Nicole je shvatila kako ga je obuzelo jedno od njegovih najkarekterističnijih raspoloženja, uzbuđenje koje sve druge povlači za sobom, i za kojim neminovno slijedi njegov vlastiti oblik melankolije koju on nikad nije pokazivao, ali koju je ona naslućivala. Ovo uzbuđenje oko stvari razvijalo bi se do intenziteta koji je u potpunom nerazmjeru s njihovom važnošću, i razbuktavalo bi u njemu zbilja izvanrednu virtuoznost u postupanju s ljudima.

Katkada bi se preneraženo osvrnuo na prave sajmove osjećaja, koje je priređivao, kao što kakav general gleda na masakr koji je zapovijedio samo da bi zadovoljio bezličnu krvoločnost.Ali biti, makar i kratko, uključen u svijet Dicka Divera značilo je osobit doživljaj: ljudi su vjerovali da on o njima ima posebno i drukčije mišljenje, da prepoznaje ponosnu jedinstvenost njihovih sudbina, zakopanu pod kompromisima brojnih godina.

Shvaćaš? Ne? Trgni se malo! To je rječita haljina - taj posebni materijal jest tu da priča priče, a netko će na krstarenju oko svijeta biti dovoljno osamljen da ih sluša.Posljednje je riječi pregrizla; za svoje već pojmove previše govorila, a Abeu je po njenom ozbiljnom licu bilo teško zaključiti je li uopće govorila. S naporom se uspravio u položaj u kojem je, iako je sjedio, djelovao kao da stoji.- Ono poslijepodne kad ste me vodili na onaj smiješni ples, znaš koji mislim, kod St. Genevieve... - počeo je.- Sjećam se. Je l' da nam je bilo zgodno?- Meni nije bilo zgodno. Nje mi čak bilo ni drago da vas vidm. Dosadili ste mi oboje, ali to se ne primjećuje zato što sam ja vama dosadio još više - znaš što hoću reći. Da se uopće mogu za što zanijeti, prebacio bih se na neke druge ljude. Grubi se šav osjetio na Nicolinoj baršunastoj rukavici kad mu je bacila natrag u lice:- Mislim da je prilično glupo, Abe, što hoćeš vrijeđati. Osim svega, ti to uopće ne misliš. Nije mi jasno zašto tako dižeš ruke od svega. Abe je promislio, trudeći se da ne zakašlje i da ne usekne nos.- Valjda mi je sve dosadilo; a onda, trebalo bi se toliko vraćati unatrag, da se može opet kamo krenuti. Čovjek se pred ženom često može igrati bespomoćnog djeteta, ali mu to gotovo nikad ne uspijeva kad se zaista osjeća kao bespomoćno dijete. - Za to nema isprike - rekla je Nicole odsječno. Abe se svakim trenutkom osjećao sve gore - nije mogao smisliti ništa osim neugodnih i nervoznih primjedbi. Nicole je držala da je za nju najispravniji stav da sjedi zureći ravno pred sebe, položiviši ruke u krilo.
