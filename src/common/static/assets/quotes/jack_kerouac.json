Bir zamanlar bu, ruhumu sevinçle doldururdu; ama tüm bunlardan keyifle bahsetmediği için, sırf yapmış olmak için yaptığı şeyleri anlattığını biliyordum. ‘’Ee, eğlenmek için ne yapıyorsun?’’ Sevgili ve seks konusunu açmaya çalıştım. Kocaman siyah gözleriyle bana boş boş ve yapmak için yanıp tutuştuğu şeyi yapamamaktan kaynaklanan, kuşaklar öncesinden gözlerine yerleşmiş bir hüsran duygusuyla baktı…neyse ne işte, herkes biliyor ne olduğunu. ‘’Hayattan ne bekliyorsun?’’ Onu sarsıp zorla içinden çıkarmak istiyordum bunu. Ne beklediği hakkında en ufak fikri yoktu. Bazı işlerden, filmlerden, yazın büyükannesinin yanına gitmekten, New York’a gidip Roxy’yi ziyaret etmek istediğinden ve ne giyeceğinden bahsetti, geçen Paskalya’da giydiği gibi bir şey olacakmış: beyaz başlık, güller, gülrengi topuklular ve deri gabardin pardösü. ‘’Pazar öğleden sonraları ne yaparsın?’’ diye sordum. Verandasında oturuyor, yoldan geçen arabaları izliyordu. Annesiyle beraber mısır patlatıyordu. ‘’Baban yaz akşamları ne yapar?’’ Çalışıyordu, bir kazan fabrikasında gece vardiyasında. ‘’Kardeşin yaz akşamları ne yapar?’’ Bisikletine biniyor, gençlerin gittiği büfenin önünde takılıyordu. ‘’Ne yapmak için yanıp tutuşuyor? Hepimiz ne için yanıp tutuşuyoruz? Ne istiyoruz?’’ Bilmiyordu. Esnedi. Uykusu vardı. Bu muhabbet ona çok gelmişti. Bu cevapları asla kimse veremezdi. Kimse asla veremeyecekti. Her şey bitmişti.

А именно: я кое-что забыл. Перед тем, как появился Дин, я собирался принять какое-то решение, а теперь его начисто вышибло у меня из головы, но оно все еще болталось на кончике языка моего разума. Я щелкал пальцами, пытаясь вспомнить его. Я даже упоминал о нем в разговоре. Больше того, сейчас я уже не мог сказать, решением ли оно было или же просто мыслью, которую я забыл. Оно не отпускало и ошеломляло меня, оно меня печалило. Оно как-то соотносилось со Странником в Саване. Карло Маркс и я однажды сели вместе на два стула друг напротив друга, соприкасаясь коленями, и я рассказал ему про свой сон о какой-то странной арабской фигуре, которая гналась за мною в пустыне; я пытался от нее убежать, а она в конце концов, настигла меня, не успел я добежать до Спасительного Града. -Кто это был? - спросил меня Карло. Мы стали об этом размышлять. Я предположил, что это был я сам, одетый в саван. Не то. Что-то, кто-то, какой-то дух преследовал нас всех по пустыне жизни и неизбежно настигал нас прежде, чем мы достигали небес. Естественно, теперь, оглядываясь назад, я могу сказать лишь одно: то была смерть; смерть настигает нас перед самыми небесами. Единственное, чего мы жаждем, пока живем, что заставляет нас вздыхать, стенать и испытывать в различных видах сладкую тошноту, - так это воспоминание о некоем утраченном блаженстве, которое, вероятно, мы пережили еще во чреве матери, и которое может быть воспроизведено лишь(хотя мы никак не желаем допустить этого) в смерти.

I could hear an indescribable seething roar which wasn’t in my ear but everywhere and had nothing to do with sounds. I realized that I had died and been reborn numberless times but just didn’t remember especially because the transitions from life to death and back to life are so ghostly easy, a magical action for naught, like falling asleep and waking up again a million times, the utter casualness and deep ignorance of it.

Kerouac’s nostalgia was for an American past he romanticized and mythologized, the prewar America of the Depression, the westward expansion, and the Old West, which he imbued with “glee,” “honesty,” “spitelessness,” and “wild selfbelieving individuality.” This desire to reconnect with “old American whoopee” was at the same time intimately linked to his idyllic yet haunted youth in Lowell, Massachusetts.
