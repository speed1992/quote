Flexibility surprising despite vast toughness.At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of head arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudo-neck, without gill suggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement. Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches diameter at base to about two and five-tenths at point.

Los Grandes Antiguos eran, los Grandes Antiguos son, y los Grandes Antiguos serán. No conocemos nada del espacio sino por intermedio de ellos. Caminan serenos y primordiales, sin dimensiones e invisibles para nosotros. Yog-Sothoth es la puerta. Yog-Sothoth es la llave y el guardián de la puerta. Pasado, presente y futuro, todo es uno en Yog-Sothoth. Él sabe por dónde entraron los Grandes Antiguos en el pasado,y por dónde volverán a irrumpir otra vez. Sabe dónde Ellos han hollado los campos de la Tierra, dónde los siguen hollando, y por qué nadie puede contemplarlos mientras lo hacen. A veces el hombre puede saber que están cerca por Su olor, pero ningún hombre puede conocer Su semblante, salvo en los rasgos de los hombres engendrados por Ellos,y los hay de muchos tipos, distinguiéndose en apariencia de la auténtica forma humana hasta la forma sin imagen ni sustancia que es la de Ellos. Caminan invisibles y hediondos en lugares solitarios donde las Palabras han sido pronunciadas y los Ritos han sido aullados en las Estaciones apropiadas. El viento gime con Sus voces, y la tierra murmura con Su voluntad. Abaten los bosques y destruyen ciudades, aunque ningún bosque o ciudad advierte la mano que los aniquila. Kadath, en el páramo helado los ha conocido; pero, ¿qué hombre conoce a Kadath? El desierto helado del Sur y las islas sumergidas del océano conservan piedras donde puede verse Su sello, pero ¿quién ha visto la helada ciudad hundida o la torre sellada engalanada con algas y percebes? El Gran Cthulhu es Su primo, aunque apenas puede entreverlos débilmente.¡Iä! ¡Shub-Niggurath! Por su olor inmundo Los conoceréis. Su mano está en vuestras gargantas, aunque no Los veáis, y Su morada se encuentra en el umbral que custodiáis. Yog-Sothoth es la llave que abre la puerta, el lugar donde se reúnen las esferas. ahora el hombre reina donde Ellos reinaron antes; pronto Ellos reinarán donde el hombre reina ahora. Después del verano viene el invierno; después del invierno, el verano.

Not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods, that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals, that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming, and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous. Not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder, for truly, it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path. Behold!

Mi experiencia no me permite dudar que el hombre, al perder su consciencia terrena, se ve de hecho albergado en otra vida incorpórea, de naturaleza distinta y alejada de la existencia que conocemos y de la que solo los recuerdos más leves y difusos se conservan tras el despertar.

In widely separated localities and under widely diverse conditions, his innate racial qualities have raised him to preeminence. There is no branch of modern civilization that is not of his making. As the power of the Roman empire declined, the Teuton sent down into Italy, Gaul, and Spain the re-vivifying elements which saved those countries from complete destruction. Though now largely lost in the mixed population, the Teutons are the true founders of all the so-called Latin states. Political and social vitality had fled from the old inhabitants; the Teuton only was creative and constructive. After the native elements absorbed the Teutonic invaders, the Latin civilizations declined tremendously, so that the France, Italy, and Spain of today bear every mark of national degeneracy.In the lands whose population is mainly Teutonic, we behold a striking proof of the qualities of the race. England and Germany are the supreme empires of the world, whilst the virile virtues of the Belgians have lately been demonstrated in a manner which will live forever in song and story. Switzerland and Holland are veritable synonyms for Liberty. The Scandinavians are immortalized by the exploits of the Vikings and Normans, whose conquests over man and Nature extended from the sun-baked shores of Sicily to the glacial wastes of Greenland, even attaining our own distant Vinland across the sea.

The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions that men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity. The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing—the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where ’Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the Ancient Ones.
