I blamed her for everything, but she didn't answer. I couldn't understand her stupid behavior! When I hit her she held still, like a true pacifist. Then I realized what she wanted was for me to love her:She began to warm up, and I saw her advantages.  Without me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was grateful. I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of her as a rose Blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain, And it was I who attracted everybody's attention, Not her whiteness and beauty, as I had at first supposed. I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up -- You could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality.  I didn't mind her waiting on me, and she adored it. In the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun From her amazingly white torso, and I couldn't help but notice Her tidiness and her calmness and her patience: She humored my weakness like the best of nurses, Holding my bones in place so they would mend properly.In time our relationship grew more intense.  She stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish. I felt her criticizing me in spite of herself, As if my habits offended her in some way. She let in the drafts and became more and more absent-minded. And my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces Simply because she looked after me so badly. Then I saw what the trouble was: she thought she was immortal.She wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior, And I'd been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful -- Wasting her days waiting on a half-corpse! And secretly she began to hope I'd die.Then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely, And wear my painted face the way a mummy-case Wears the face of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.  I wasn't in any position to get rid of her. She'd supported me for so long I was quite limp -- I had forgotten how to walk or sit, So I was careful not to upset her in any way Or brag ahead of time how I'd avenge myself. Living with her was like living with my own coffin: Yet I still depended on her, though I did it regretfully. I used to think we might make a go of it together -- After all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close. Now I see it must be one or the other of us. She may be a saint, and I may be ugly and hairy, But she'll soon find out that that doesn't matter a bit.

I am not content, because my lot is limiting, as are all others.

To drive into burning dark of oblivion? To lose identity? Not love, this, quite. But something else rather. A refined hedonism. Hedonism: because of the blind sucking mouthing fingering quest for physical gratification. Refined: because of the desire to stimulate another in return, not being quite only concerned for self alone, but mostly so. An easy end to arguments on the mouth: a warm meeting of mouths, tongues quivering, licking, tasting. An easy substitute for bad slashing with angry hating teeth and nails and voice: the curious musical tempo of hands lifting under breasts, caressing throat, shoulders, knees, thighs. And giving up to the corrosive black whirlpool of mutual necessary destruction. - Once there is the first kiss, then the cycle becomes inevitable. Training, conditioning, make a hunger burn in breasts and secrete fluid in vagina, driving blindly for destruction. What is it but destruction? Some mystic desire to beat to sensual annihilation - to snuff out one’s identity on the identity of the other - a mingling and mangling of identities? A death of one? Or both? A devouring and subordination? No, no. A polarization rather - a balance of two integrities, changing, electrically, one with the other, yet with centers of coolness, like stars. And there it is: when asked what role I will plan to fill, I say “What do you mean role? I plan not to step into a part on marrying - but to go on living as an intelligent mature human being, growing and learning as I always have. No shift, no radical change in life habits. Never will there be a circle, signifying me and my operations, confined solely to home, other womenfolk, and community service, enclosed in the larger worldly circle of my mate, who brings home from his periphery of contact with the world the tales only of vicarious experience to me.No, rather, there will be two over-lapping circles, with a certain strong riveted center of common ground, but both with separate arcs jutting out in the world. A balanced tension; adaptible to circumstances, in which there is an elasticity of pull, tension, yet firm unity. Two stars, polarized; in moments of communication that is complete, almost fusing onto one. But fusion is an undesirable impossibility - and quite non-durable. So there will be no illusion of that.So he accuses me of “struggling for dominance”? Sorry, wrong number. Sure, I’m a little scared of being dominated. (Who isn’t?

I, too, was stunted, narrowed, warped, by my environment, my outcroppings of heredity. I, too, will find a set of beliefs, of standards to live by, yet the very satisfaction of finding them will be marred by the fact that I have reached the ultimate in shallow, two-dimensional living - a set of values. This loneliness will blur and diminish, no doubt, when tomorrow I plunge again into classes, into the necessity of studying for exams. But now, that false purpose is lifted and I am spinning in a temporary vacuum. At home I rested and played, here, where I work, the routine is momentarily suspended and I am lost. There is no living being on earth at this moment except myself. I could walk down the halls, and empty rooms would yawn mockingly at me from every side. God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of \"parties\" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.

After a climb, an ascent from one jagged foothold to another, a natural shelf is reached where one person can stretch at length, and stare down into the tide rising and falling below, or beyond to the bay, where sails catch light, then shadow, then light, as they tack far out near the horizon. The sun has burned these rocks, and the great continuous ebb and flow of the tide has crumbled the boulders, battered them, worn them down to the smooth sun-scalded stones on the beach which rattle and shift underfoot as one walks over them. A serene sense of the slow inevitability of the gradual changes in the earth’s crust comes over me; a consuming love, not of a god, but of the clean unbroken sense that the rocks, which are nameless, the waves which are nameless, the ragged grass, which is nameless, are all defined momentarily through the consciousness of the being who observes them. With the sun burning into rock and flesh, and the wind ruffling grass and hair, there is an awareness that the blind immense unconscious impersonal and neutral forces will endure, and that the fragile, miraculously knit organism which interprets them, endows them with meaning, will move about for a little, then falter, fail, and decompose at last into the anonomous [sic] soil, voiceless, faceless, without identity.From this experience I emerged whole and clean, bitten to the bone by sun, washed pure by the icy sharpness of salt water, dried and bleached to the smooth tranquillity that comes from dwelling among primal things.From this experience also, a faith arises to carry back to a human world of small lusts and deceitful pettiness. A faith, naïve and child like perhaps, born as it is from the infinite simplicity of nature. It is a feeling that no matter what the ideas or conduct of others, there is a unique rightness and beauty to life which can be shared in openness, in wind and sunlight, with a fellow human being who believes in the same basic principles."},{"id":1009,"quote":"They mistake their star, these papery godfolk."},{"id":1010,"quote":"I don't see what women see in other women, I told Doctor Nolan in my interview that noon.

Only in the rain, sometimes, only when the rain comes, closing in your pitifully small radius of activity, only when you sit and listen by the window, as the cold wet air blows thinly by the back of your neck - only then do you think and feel sick. You feel the days slipping by, elusive as slippery pink worms, through your fingers, and you wonder what you have for your eighteen years, and you think about how, with difficulty and concentration, you could bring back a day, a day of sun, blue skies and watercoloring by the sea. You could remember the sensual observations that made that day reality, and you could delude yourself into thinking - almost - that you could return to the past, and relive the days and hours in a quick space of time. But no, the quest of time past is more difficult than you think, and time present is eaten up by such plaintive searchings. The film of your days and nights is wound up tight in you, never to be re-run - and the occasional flashbacks are faint, blurred, unreal, as if seen through falling snow. Now, you begin to get scared. You don't believe in God, or a life-after-death, so you can't hope for sugar plums when your non-existent soul rises. You believe that whatever there is has got to come from man, and man is pretty creative in his good moments - pretty mature, pretty perceptive for his age - how many years is it, now? How many thousands? Yet, yet in this era of specialization, of infinite variety and complexity and myriad choices, what do you pick for yourself out of the grab-bag? Cats have nine lives, the saying goes. You have one; and somewhere along the thin, tenuous thread of your existence there is the black knot, the blood clot, the stopped heartbeat that spells the end of this particular individual which is spelled \"I\" and \"You\" and \"Sylvia.\" So you wonder how to act, and how to be - and you wonder about values and attitudes. In the relativism and despair, in the waiting for the bombs to begin, for the blood (now spurting in Korea, in Germany, in Russia) to flow and trickle before your own eyes, you wonder with a quick sick fear how to cling to earth, to the seeds of grass and life. You wonder about your eighteen years, ricocheting between a stubborn determination that you've done well for your own capabilities and opportunities... that you're competing now with girls from all over America, and not just from the hometown: and a fear that you haven't done well enough - You wonder if you've got what it takes to keep building up obstacle courses for your self, and to keep leaping through them, sprained ankle or not. Again the refrain, what have you for your eighteen years? And you know that whatever tangible things you do have, they cannot be held, but, too, will decompose and slip away through your coarse-skinned and death-rigid fingers. So you will rot in the ground, and so you say, what the hell? Who cares? But you care, and somehow you don't want to live just one life, which could be typed, which could be tossed off in a thumbnail sketch = \"She was the sort of girl....

People live in war time, they always have. There was terror down through history - and the men who saw the Spanish Armada sail over the rim of the world, who saw the Black death wipe out half of Europe, those men were frightened, terrified. But though they lived and died in fear, I am here; we have built again. And so I will belong to a dark age, and historians will say \"We have few documents to show how the common people lived at this time. Records lead us to believe that a majority were killed. But there were glorious men.\" And school children will sigh and learn the names of Truman and Senator McCarthy. Oh, it is hard for me to reconcile myself to this. But maybe this is why I am a girl - - - so I can live more safely than the boys I have known and envied, so I can bear children, and instill in them the biting eating desire to learn and love life which I will never quite fulfill, because there isn't time, because there isn't time at all, but instead the quick desperate fear, the ticking clock, and the snow which comes too suddenly upon the summer. Sure, I'm dramatic and sloppily semi-cynical and semi-sentimental. But in leisure years I could grow and choose my way. Now I am living on the edge. We all are on the brink, and it takes a lot of nerve, a lot of energy, to teeter on the edge, looking over, looking down into the windy blackness and not being quite able to make out, through the yellow, stinking mist, just what lies below in the slime, in the oozing, vomit-streaked slime; and so I could go on, into my thoughts, writing much, trying to find the core, the meaning for myself. Perhaps that would help, to synthesize my ideas into a philosophy for me, now, at the age of eighteen, but the clock ticks, ah yes, \"At my back I hear, time's winged chariot hovering near.\" And I have too much conscience, too much habit to sit and stare at snow, thick now, and evenly white and muffling on the ground. God, I scream for time to let go, to write, to think. But no. I have to exercise my memory in little feats just so I can stay in this damn wonderful place which I love and hate with all my heart. And so the snow slows and swirls, and melts along the edges. The first snow isn't good for much. It makes a few people write poetry, a few wonder if the Christmas shopping is done, a few make reservations at the skiing lodge. It's a sentimental prelude to the real thing.

I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as waterTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.I didn’t want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how free——The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet. The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind meWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.Before they came the air was calm enough,Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,And comes from a country far away as health."},{"id":1634,"quote":"I simply don’t know what to do.

Если я становлюсь свидетельницей дорожной аварии или уличной драки или же мне в лаборатории показывают мертвого младенца под стеклянным колпаком, я гляжу во все глаза и стараюсь навсегда запомнить это зрелище. Таким образом мне удалось узнать множество людей, которых я ни за что не узнала бы иначе, — и даже если они удивляют меня или причиняют мне боль, я никогда не отвожу глаз и делаю вид, будто мне и без того известно, что на самом деле мир именно настолько ужасен.Должно быть, есть на свете напасти, от которых не в силах исцелить и горячая ванна, но я таких почти не знаю. Как только меня начинает томить печаль, как только я чувствую себя умирающей, как только разнервничаюсь до такой степени, что не могу заснуть, как только в кого-нибудь влюблюсь или разлучусь с возлюбленным на неделю, как только дохожу до определенной точки отчаяния, я говорю себе: «А приму-ка я сейчас горячую ванну». ... Нигде я не чувствую себя настолько собой, как в горячей ванне.Я лежала в горячей ванне на семнадцатом этаже гостиницы только для женщин, высоко над суматохой и сумятицей Нью-Йорка, примерно час и в конце концов почувствовала себя очистившейся. Я не верю в крещение и в реки Иорданские или во что-нибудь другое в том же роде, но, сдается мне, в горячей ванне я ощущаю нечто схожее с тем, что испытывают верующие, погружаясь в освященную воду.Я убеждала самое себя: «Дорин больше не существует, Ленни Шеперда больше не существует, Фрэнки больше не существует, Нью-Йорка больше не существует, их всех больше не существует, они растворяются, исчезают, не имеют никакого значения. Я их знать не знаю и никогда не знала, а сама я чрезвычайно чиста. Вся выпивка и все вонючие поцелуи, свидетелями которых я стала, и вся грязь, налипшая на мое тело по пути домой, превращаются сейчас в нечто чрезвычайно чистое».Моя бабушка неизменно приобретала что подешевле, и у нее вдобавок была пренеприятная привычка произносить, когда ты подносишь ложку ко рту, что-нибудь вроде: «Надеюсь, тебе это придется по вкусу. Оно обошлось мне в сорок один цент на фунт», вследствие чего начинало казаться, что пожираешь медяки, а вовсе не воскресный бифштекс.Я ненавижу цветные фильмы. В цветном фильме каждый из персонажей чувствует себя обязанным менять один умопомрачительный туалет на другой буквально в каждой сцене и торчит, как лошадь в цветастой попоне, то под сенью чрезвычайно зеленых деревьев, то на фоне чрезвычайно пшеничной пшеницы, то на берегу иссиня-синего моря, волны которого разбегаются во все стороны на многие мили.Люди сделаны из дерьма, люди набиты дерьмом, и я не понимаю, почему лечить это дерьмо - занятие более достойное, чем сочинять стихи, которые кто-нибудь может запомнить и прочитать наизусть другому в часы тоски, близости и бессонницы.И я понимала, что, несмотря на все эти розы, и поцелуи, и ресторанные угощения, и прочие знаки внимания, которые мужчина выказывает своей избраннице до женитьбы, в глубине души он хочет только того, чтобы все это осталось позади, а его благоверная начала стелиться ему под ноги, как кухонный коврик миссис Уиллард.Ведь сама же мать рассказала мне, что как только они с отцом в свой медовый месяц уехали из Рено (отец уже был женат, поэтому ему понадобился развод), отец сказал ей: «О Господи, какая радость, что мы можем наконец прекратить что-то из себя строить и станем самими собой». И начиная с этого дня у моей матери не было ни минуты покоя.И я прекрасно помню, как Бадди Уиллард с циничным видом знатока объявил мне, что, став матерью, я сильно переменюсь и перестану писать стихи. Поэтому мне порой казалось, что выйти замуж и обзавестись детьми — это все равно что подвергнуться промыванию мозгов, и твоя участь будет похожа на судьбу немого раба в некоем приватном, но тем не менее тоталитарном царстве"},{"id":1707,"quote":"her thoughts were not my thoughts, nor her feelings my feelings, but we were close enough so that her thoughts and feelings seemed a wry, black image of my own"},{"id":1708,"quote":"What happens between us Happens in darkness, vanishes Easy and often as each breath."},{"id":1709,"quote":"The blood jet is poetry,There is no stopping it.'Kindness' by Sylvia Plath"},{"id":1710,"quote":"Nëse të qenit neurotike do të thotë të duash dy gjëra, që në të njëjtën kohë e përjashtojnë njëra-tjetrën, atëherë unë jam neurotike si dreqi.

And then one reads in the papers \"Second bomb blast in Nevada bigger than the first! \" What obsession do men have for destruction and murder? Why do we electrocute men for murdering an individual and then pin a purple heart on them for mass slaughter of someone arbitrarily labeled \"enemy?\" Weren't the Russians communists when they helped us slap down the Germans? And now. What could we do with the Russian nation if we bombed it to bits? How could we \"rule\" such a mass of foreign people - - - we, who don't even speak the Russian language? How could we control them under our \"democratic\" system, we, who even now are losing that precious commodity, freedom of speech? (Mr. Crockett,\" that dear man, was questioned by the town board. A supposedly \"enlightened\" community. All he is is a pacifist. That, it seems, is a crime.) Why do we send the pride of our young men overseas to be massacred for three dirty miles of nothing but earth? Korea was never divided into \"North\" and \"South.\" They are one people; and our democracy is of no use to those who have not been educated to it. Freedom is not of use to those who do not know how to employ it.

Of lizard-like humans crawling up a hillside? All she knows is movies and school room gossip. Oh, America's young, strong. So is Russia.

War will come some day now, with all the hothead leaders and articles \"What If Women are Drafted?\" Hell, I'd sooner be a citizen of Africa than see America mashed and bloody and making a fool of herself. This country has a lot, but we're not always right and pure. And what of the veterans of the first and second world wars? The maimed, the crippled. What good their lives? Nothing. They rot in the hospitals, and we forget them. I could love a Russian boy - and live with him. It's the living, the eating, the sleeping that everyone needs. Ideas don't matter so much after all. My three best friends are Catholic. I can't see their beliefs, but I can see the things they love to do on earth.

I wanted him. \"I don't have to tell you it's been nice,\" I said at the door. \"It's been marvelous,\" he smiled. \"I'll call you. Take care.\" And he was gone.

God save us from doing that again. For the United States did that. Our guilt. My country. No, never again. And then one reads in the papers \"Second bomb blast in Nevada bigger than the first! \" What obsession do men have for destruction and murder? Why do we electrocute men for murdering an individual and then pin a purple heart on them for mass slaughter of someone arbitrarily labeled \"enemy?\" Weren't the Russians communists when they helped us slap down the Germans? And now. What could we do with the Russian nation if we bombed it to bits? How could we \"rule\" such a mass of foreign people - - - we, who don't even speak the Russian language? How could we control them under our \"democratic\" system, we, who even now are losing that precious commodity, freedom of speech? (Mr. Crockett,\" that dear man, was questioned by the town board. A supposedly \"enlightened\" community. All he is is a pacifist. That, it seems, is a crime.) Why do we send the pride of our young men overseas to be massacred for three dirty miles of nothing but earth? Korea was never divided into \"North\" and \"South.\" They are one people; and our democracy is of no use to those who have not been educated to it. Freedom is not of use to those who do not know how to employ it. When I think of that little girl on the farm talking about her brother - \"And he said all they can think of over there is killing those God-damn Koreans.\" What does she know of war? Of lizard-like humans crawling up a hillside? All she knows is movies and school room gossip. Oh, America's young, strong. So is Russia. And how they can think of atom-bombing each other, I don't know. What will be left? War will come some day now, with all the hothead leaders and articles \"What If Women are Drafted?\" Hell, I'd sooner be a citizen of Africa than see America mashed and bloody and making a fool of herself. This country has a lot, but we're not always right and pure. And what of the veterans of the first and second world wars? The maimed, the crippled. What good their lives? Nothing. They rot in the hospitals, and we forget them. I could love a Russian boy - and live with him. It's the living, the eating, the sleeping that everyone needs. Ideas don't matter so much after all. My three best friends are Catholic. I can't see their beliefs, but I can see the things they love to do on earth.
