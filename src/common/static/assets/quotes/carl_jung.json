We are entirely free to choose which point of view we take; it will in any case be an arbitrary decision.There is, however, a strong empirical reason why we should cultivate thoughts that can never be proved. It is that they are known to be useful. Man positively needs general ideas and convictions that will give a meaning to his life and enable him to find a place for himself in the universe. He can stand the most incredible hardships when he is convinced that they make sense; he is crushed when, on top of all his misfortunes, he has to admit that he is taking part in a \"tale told by an idiot.\"It is the role of religious symbols to give a meaning to the life of man. The Pueblo Indians believe that they are the sons of Father Sun, and this belief endows their life with a perspective (and a goal) that goes far beyond their limited existence.

I regard intuition as a basic psychological function (q.v.). It is the function that mediates perceptions in an unconscious way.

The peculiarity of intuition is that it is neither sense perception, nor feeling, nor intellectual inference, although it may also appear in these forms. In intuition a content presents itself whole and complete, without our being able to explain or discover how this content came into existence. Intuition is a kind of instinctive apprehension, no matter of what contents. Like sensation (q.v.), it is an irrational (q.v.) function of perception. As with sensation, its contents have the character of being “given, in contrast to the “derived” or “produced” character of thinking and feeling (qq.v.) contents. Intuitive knowledge possesses an intrinsic certainty and conviction, which enabled Spinoza (and Bergson) to uphold the scientia intuitiva as the highest form of knowledge.

The encounter between conscious and unconscious has to ensure that the light which shines in the darkness is not only comprehended by the darkness, but comprehends it. The filius solis et lunae (the son of the Sun and Moon) is the possible result as well as the symbol of this union of opposites.

The rabbi replied: \"Nowadays there is now longer anybody who can bow low enough.\"This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. The Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Church and his Bible between himself and his unconscious; and the rational intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche.

One of them is that some single instinctive drive or emotional image can carry him into a one-sidedness that makes him lose his balance. This also happens to animals; for example, a sexually excited stag will completely forget hunger and security. This one-sidedness and consequent loss of balance are much dreaded by primitives, who call it, \"loss of soul.\" Another threat to the inner balance comes from excessive daydreaming, which in a secret way usually circles around particular complexes. In fact, daydreams arise just because they connect a man with his complexes; at the same time they threaten the concentration and continuity of his consciousness.The second obstacle is exactly the opposite, and is due to an over-consolidation of ego-consciousness. Although a disciplined consciousness is necessary for the performance of civilized activities (we know what happens if a railway signalman lapses into daydreaming), it has the serious disadvantage that it is apt to block the reception of impulses and messages coming from the center.

These limit his perception of the world around him. By using scientific instruments he can partly compensate for the deficiencies of his senses. For example, he can extend the range of his vision by binoculars or of his hearing by electrical amplification.

For this reason the possibility of enlarging it exists, at least during the first half of life.

In this way a considerable increase of personality may be experienced. We therefore tend to assume that this increase comes only from without, thus justifying the prejudice that one becomes a personality by stuffing into oneself as much as possible from outside. But the more assiduously we follow this recipe, and the more stubbornly we believe that all increase has to come from without, the greater becomes our inner poverty. Therefore, if some great idea takes hold of us from outside, we must understand that it takes hold of us only because something in us responds to it and goes out to meet it. Richness of mind consists in mental receptivity, not in the accumulation of possessions. What comes to us from outside, and, for that matter, everything that rises up from within, can only be made our own if we are capable of an inner amplitude equal to that of the incoming content. Real increase of personality means consciousness of an enlargement that flows from inner sources. Without psychic depth we can never be adequately related to the magnitude of our object.

The inborn but hidden totality of the psyche is not the same thing as a wholeness that is fully realized and lived.One could picture this in the following way: The seed of a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particular place, in which there are a number of special factors, such as the quality of the soil and the stones, the slope of the land, and its exposure to the sun and wind. The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree's growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality.

So you sink back against the wall, and when you have crawled through all the glow- ing hot crucibles of the Hell of doubt, you sit once more and leanback, and look at the wonder of the Summa that lies spread out before you. Here and there a light flickers, here and there a fruit falls. For you it is all too little. But you begin to be satisfied with yourself, and you pay no attention to the years passing away. What are years? What is hurrying time to him that sits under a tree? Your time passes like a breath of air and you wait for the next light, the next fruit.The writing lies before you and always says the same, if you believe in words. But if you believe in things in whose places only words stand, you never come to the end. And yet you must go an endless road, since life flows not only down a finite path but also an infinite one. But the unbounded makes you53 anxious since the unbounded is fearful and your humanity rebels against it. Consequently you seek limits and restraints so that you do not lose yoursel£ tumbling into infinity Restraint becomes imperative for you. You cry out for the word which has one meaning and no other, so that you escape boundless ambiguity. The word becomes your God, since it protects you from the countless possibilities of interpretation. The word is protective magic against the daimons of the unending, which tear at your soul and want to scatter you to the winds. You are saved if you can say at last: that is that and only that. You spealc the magic word, and the limitless is finally banished. Because of that men seek and make words.54He who breaks the wall ofwords overthrows Gods and defiles temples. The solitary is a murderer. He murders the people, because he thus thinks and thereby breaks down ancient sacred walls. He calls up the daimons of the boundless. And he sits, leans back, and does not hear the groans of mankind, whom the fearful fiery smoke has seized. And yet you cannot find the new words if you do not shatter the old words. But no one should shatter the old words, unless he finds the new word that is a firm rampart against the limitless and grasps more life in it than in the old word. A new word is a new God for old men. Man remains the same, even if you create a new model of God for him. He remains an imitator. What was word, shall become man. The word created the world and came before the world. It lit up like a light in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.55 And thus the wordshould become what the darkness can comprehend, since what use is the light if the darkness does not comprehend it? But your darkness should grasp the light.The God of words is cold and dead and shines from afar like the moon, mysteriously and inaccessibly: Let the word return to its / creator, to man, and thus the word will be heightened in man. Man should be light, limits, measure. May he be your fruit, for which you longingly reach. The darkness does not compre- hend the word, but rather man; indeed, it seizes him, since he himself is a piece of the darkness. Not from the word down to man, but from the word up to man: that is what the darkness comprehends. The darkness is your mother; she is dangerous."},{"id":1371,"quote":"Not so very long ago there were medical authorities who did not \"believe\" in bacteria and consequently allowed twenty thousand young women to die of easily avoidable puerperal fever in Germany alone.

Therefore, one says, principiis obsta, resist delights and passions, resist in the beginning before it is too late, don't have passions, it is not good taste, it is bad form. The deeper reason is that if one slips too far into such flames, one is sure to land in criminality. But how can you live and have no passion-for then you would escape suffering? Nobody can escape suffering, and to try to escape passion is to try to escape suffering. But as you cannot escape suffering you cannot escape passion; you will suffer from passion either directly or indirectly, and it is much better to suffer directly because indirect suffering has no merit. It is exactly as if nothing has happened. So the indirect suffering in a neurosis has no moral merit. Years lost in neurosis are just lost, without gain. But if you suffer directly and you know for what you suffer, that is never lost. Therefore, Christ said that if you know what you are doing you are blessed, but if you don't know you are cursed.?

In the morning it gains continually in strength until it reaches the zenith-heat of high noon. Then comes the enantiodromia: the steady forward movement no longer denotes an increase, but a decrease, in strength. Thus our task in handling a young person is different from the task of handling an older person. In the former case, it is enough to clear away all the obstacles that hinder expansion and ascent; in the latter, we must nurture everything that assists the descent. An inexperienced youth thinks one can let the old people go, because not much more can happen to them anyway: they have their lives behind them and are no better than petrified pillars of the past. But it is a great mistake to suppose that the meaning of life is exhausted with the period of youth and expansion; that, for example, a woman who has passed the menopause is “finished. The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning; only, its meaning and purpose are different.14 Man has two aims: the first is the natural aim, the begetting of children and the business of protecting the brood; to this belongs the acquisition of money and social position. When this aim has been reached a new phase begins: the cultural aim. For the attainment of the former we have the help of nature and, on top of that, education; for the attainment of the latter, little or nothing helps. Often, indeed, a false ambition survives, in that an old man wants to be a youth again, or at least feels he must behave like one, although in his heart he can no longer make believe. This is what makes the transition from the natural to the cultural phase so terribly difficult and bitter for many people; they cling to the illusion of youth or to their children, hoping to salvage in this way a last little scrap of youth. One sees it especially in mothers, who find their sole meaning in their children and imagine they will sink into a bottomless void when they have to give them up. No wonder that many bad neuroses appear at the onset of life’s afternoon. It is a sort of second puberty, another “storm and stress” period, not infrequently accompanied by tempests of passion—the “dangerous age.” But the problems that crop up at this age are no longer to be solved by the old recipes: the hand of this clock cannot be put back.

Our criminal instinct is not satisfied by this damned reasonableness, so we get bitter and poisonous and more and more reasonable, but we are really just waiting for the time when we can take a revolver and kill; we are waiting for an age of revolution, for an age of cruelty. So it would be much better if we could begin at the beginning and put the criminal to death by public execution; it doesn't make us any more cruel than we are already. Look at the things that happen in the world! The amount of quite open cruelty is incredible. One reads about in in the papers.

Odinioară, cizmarii țineau pantofii între genunchi și trăgeau firele prin piele cu niște mișcări foarte asemănătoare. (La cizmarii de la sate se mai poate vedea și astăzi.)

Individualism means deliberately stressing and giving prominence to some supposed peculiarity rather than to collective consideration and obligations. But individuation means precisely the better and more complete fulfillment of the collective qualities of the human being, since adequate consideration of the peculiarity of the individual is more conducive to a better social performance than when the peculiarity is neglected or suppressed. The idiosyncrasy of an individual is not to be understood as any strangeness in his substance or in his components, but rather as a unique combination, or gradual differentiation, of functions and faculties which in themselves are universal. Every human face has a nose, two eyes, etc., but these universal factors are variable, and it is this variability which makes individual peculiarities possible. Individuation, therefore, can only mean a process of psychological development that fulfils the individual qualities given; in other words, it is a process by which a man becomes the definite, unique being he in fact is.

To find out which is the correct interpretation requires an honest, attentive attitude and careful thought. But, as is the case with all inner processes, it is ultimately the Self that orders and regulates one's human relationships, so long as the conscious ego takes the trouble to detect the delusive projections and deals with these inside himself instead of outside. It is in this way that spiritually attuned and similarly oriented people find their way to one another, to create a group that cuts across all the usual social and organizational affiliations of people. Such a group is not in conflict with others; it is merely different and independent. The consciously realized process of individuation thus changes a person's relationships.

Sometimes, even with the best intentions this dilemma cannot be solved. This is the moment when the primitive trusts himself to a higher authority and to a decision beyond his comprehension. The civilized man in his closed-in environment functions in a fitting and appropriate manner, that is, rationally. But if, because of some apparently insoluble dilemma, he gets outside the confines of civilization, he becomes a primitive again; then he has irrational ideas and acts on hunches; then he no longer thinks but “it” thinks in him; then he needs “magical” practices in order to gain a feeling of security; then the latent autonomy of the unconscious becomes active and begins to manifest itself as it has always done in the past.”"},{"id":1605,"quote":"It consisted essentially in a dialectical gymnastics which gave the symbol of speech, the word, an absolute meaning, so that words came in the end to have a substantiality with which the ancients could invest their Logos only by attributing to it a mystical value.

Musím vždy znovu zdůraznit, že ani mravní zákon, ani pojem Bůh, ani jakékoli náboženství nenapadly člověka zvnějšku, jaksi z nebe, ale že to vše má člověk in nuce v sobě a že si to tedy také vytvořil sám ze sebe. Je tudíž naprosto liché si myslet, že k zapuzení těchto strašidel stačí pouhé vysvětlení. Ideje mravního zákona a božství patří k nevykořenitelnému vlastnictví lidské duše. Proto se každá poctivá psychologie, kterou nezaslepilo šosácké osvětářské tmářství, s těmito skutečnostmi musí vyrovnávat. Vysvětlováním ani ironií se jich nezbavíte.

Věčné zaměňování objektu a imaga vede přirozeně k tomu, že ve svém myšlení neumíme rozlišit mezi „Bohem“ a „imagem (obrazem) Boha“, takže se domníváme, že mluvíme o Bohu a že podáváme „teologické“ vysvětlení, když hovoříme o „obrazu Boha“."},{"id":1692,"quote":"The words that oscillate between nonsense and supreme meaning are the oldest and truest."},{"id":1693,"quote":"An evil person lurks inside all of us, and onlyif we recognize that fact can we hope totame them [sic]."},{"id":1694,"quote":"The unconscious no sooner touches us than we are it―we become unconscious of ourselves. That is the age-old danger, instinctively known and feared by primitive man, who himself stands so very close to this pleroma. His consciousness is still uncertain, wobbling on its feet. It is still childish, having just emerged from the primal waters. A wave of the unconscious may easily roll over it, and then he forgets who he was and does things that are strange to him. Hence primitives are afraid of uncontrolled emotions, because consciousness breaks down under them and gives way to possession. All man's strivings have therefore been directed towards the consolidation of consciousness. This was the purpose of rite and dogma; they were dams and walls to keep back the dangers of the unconscious, the \"perils of the soul.\" Primitive rites consist accordingly in the exorcising of spirits, the lifting of spells, the averting of the evil omen, propitiation, purification, and the production by sympathetic magic of helpful occurrences."},{"id":1695,"quote":"For example, a suitable explanation or a comforting word to the patient may have something like a healing effect which may even influence the glandular secretions.

The words are effective only in so far as they convey a meaning or have significance. It is their meaning which is effective. But \"meaning\" is something mental or spiritual. Call it a fiction if you like. None the less it enables us to influence the course of the disease in a far more effective way than with chemical preparations. We can even influence the biochemical processes of the body by it. Whether the fiction arises in me spontaneously, or reaches me from without by way of human speech, it can make me ill or cure me.

I saw first in the Boboli gardens the two wonderful figures of the barbarians-you remember perhaps those antique stone statues. They are made of stone, consist of stone, represent the spirit of stone: you feel that stone has had the word! Then I went to the tombs of the Medici and saw what Michelangelo did to stone; there the stone has been brought to a super-life. It makes gestures which stone never would make; it is hysterical and exaggerated. The difference was amazing. Or go further to a man like Houdon and you see that the stone becomes absolutely acrobatic. There is the same difference between the Norman and Gothic styles. In the Gothic frame of mind stone behaves like a plant, not like a normal stone, while the Norman style is completely suggested by the stone. The stone speaks. Also an antique Egyptian temple is a most marvelous example of what stone can say; the Greek temple already plays tricks with stone, but the Egyptian temple is made of stone. It grows out of stone — the temple of Abu Simbel, for example, is amazing in that respect. Then in those cave temples in India one sees again the thing man brings into stone. He takes it into his hands and makes it jump, fills it with an uncanny sort of life which destroys the peculiar spirit of the stone. And in my opinion it is always to the detriment of art when matter has no say in the game of the artist. The quality of the matter is exceedingly important — it is all-important. For instance, I think it makes a tremendous difference whether one paints with chemical colors or with so-called natural colors. All that fuss medieval painters made about the preparation of their backgrounds or the making and mixing of their colors had a great advantage. No modern artist has ever brought out anything like the colors which those old masters produced. If one studies an old picture, one feels directly that the color speaks, the color has its own life, but with a modern artist it is most questionable whether the color has a life of its own. It is all made by man, made in Germany or anywhere else, and one feels it. So the projection into matter is not only a very important but an indispensable quality of art. Jung, C. G..

Пожалуй, мы не признаемся в том, что нуждаемся в воспитании, потому что это беззастенчивым образом напомнило бы нам о том, что мы сами все еще дети и в значительной мере нуждаемся в воспитании.Мне кажется, что этим сомнением безусловно стоит поделиться, если уж из детей хотят воспитать \"личностей\". Личность — это не зародыш в ребенке, который развивается лишь постепенно, благодаря жизни или в ее ходе. Без определенности, целостности и созревания личность не проявится. Эти три свойства не могут и не должны быть присущи ребенку, потому что с ними он был бы лишен детства. Он был бы противоестественной, скороспелой заменой взрослого. Однако таких монстров современное воспитание уже вывело, а именно в тех случаях, когда родителей одолевает настоящий фанатизм — обеспечить детей всегда и везде всем \"самым лучшим\" и \"жить только ради них\". Этот весьма популярный стереотип больше всего мешает родителям развиваться самим, и он же дает им право навязывать детям свое собственное \"лучшее\". Однако в действительности это \"лучшее\" представляет собой то, чем родители более всего пренебрегают в отношении самих себя. Детей ориентируют на то, чтобы добиваться именно того, чего не добились родители, им навязывают амбиции, которые родители так и не смогли реализовать. Такие методы и идеалы порождают педагогических монстров.Никто не в состоянии воспитать личность, если он сам не является личностью. И не ребенок, а только взрослый может достичь этого уровня развития в качестве спелого плода жизненных свершений, направленных на эту цель. Ведь достичь уровня личности означает максимально развернуть целостность индивидуальной сущности. Нельзя упускать из виду, насколько велико число тех условий, которые должны быть выполнены ради этой цели. Здесь требуется вся человеческая жизнь со всеми ее биологическими, социальными и психологическими аспектами. Личность — высшая реализация врожденного своеобразия у отдельного живого существа.

Мы как солнце, которое питает жизнь земли и производит всякого рода прекрасное, диковинное и дурное; мы как матери, которые носят во чреве еще неизведанное счастье и страдание. Мы не знаем наперед, какие дела и злодеяния, какая судьба, какое добро и какое зло содержатся в нас; и только осень покажет, что было зачато весною; лишь вечером станет ясно, что началось утром.Личность как полная реализация целостности нашего существа — недостижимый идеал. Однако недостижимость не является доводом против идеала, потому что идеалы — не что иное, как указатели пути, но никак не цели.Человеческий же дух кругом увяз в диковинных противоречиях. Мы превозносим \"священное материнство\" и не думаем о том, что его следует сделать ответственным за всех человеческих монстров, за уголовников, за буйно помешанных, за эпилептиков, идиотов и калек всяческих видов: ведь они тоже были рождены. Но нас охватывает сильнейшее сомнение, когда от нас требуется гарантировать человеческой личности свободное развитие. Это означает, что \"тогда все было бы возможно\". Ведь никто не развивает личность только потому, что ему сказали, будто это дело полезное или благоразумное. Природа еще никогда не внимала доброжелательным советам. Только каузально действующее принуждение заставляет шевелиться природу, в том числе и человеческую. Без нужды ничего не изменяется, и менее всего человеческая личность. Она чудовищно консервативна, если не сказать инертна. Только острейшая нужда в состоянии ее вспугнуть. Так и развитие личности повинуется не желанию, не приказу и не намерению, а только необходимости: личность нуждается в мотивирующем принуждении со стороны судеб, исходящих изнутри или приходящих извне.Слова \"Многие призваны, но немногие избраны\" относятся более всего именно сюда, ибо развитие личности от исходных задатков до полной сознательности — это харизма и одновременно проклятие: первое следствие этого развития есть сознательное и неминуемое обособление отдельного существа из неразличимости и бессознательности стада. Это — одиночество, и по этому поводу нельзя сказать ничего утешительного. От этого не избавит никакое успешное приспособление и никакое беспрепятственное прилаживание к существующему окружению, а также ни семья, ни общество, ни положение. Развитие личности — это такое счастье, за которое можно дорого заплатить. Тот, кто более всего говорит о развертывании личности, менее всего думает о последствиях, которые сами по себе способны напрочь отпугнуть слабых духом.Однако развитие личности означает все же нечто большее, чем просто боязнь страшных последствий или одиночества: оно означает также верность собственному закону."},{"id":1741,"quote":"But people who are not above the general level of consciousness have not yet discovered that it is just as pre- sumptuous and fantastic to assume that matter produces mind, that apes give rise to human beings, that from the harmonious interplay of the drives of hunger, love, and power Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason should have emerged, and that all this could not possibly be other than it is."},{"id":1742,"quote":"He was the man I mentioned who was obsessed by the idea that he had cancer, although X-rays had proved to him that it was all imaginary.

Under certain conditions it could even break through the barriers of space and time precisely because of a quality essential to it, that is, its relatively trans- spatial and trans-temporal nature. This possible transcendence of space-time, for which it seems to me there is a good deal of evidence, is of such incalculable import that it should spur the spirit of research to the greatest effort.

I wanted the healing processes to grow out of the patient’s own personality, not from suggestions by me that would have only a passing effect. My aim was to protect and preserve my patient’s dignity and freedom, so that he could live his life according to his own wishes. In this exchange with Freud, it dawned on me for the first time that before we construct general theories about man and his psyche we should learn a lot more about the real human being we have to deal with. The individual is the only reality. The further we move away from the individual toward abstract ideas about Homo sapiens, the more likely we are to fall into error. In these times of social upheaval and rapid change, it is desirable to know much more than we do about the individual human being, for so much depends upon his mental and moral qualities.

И здесь становится ясно, сколь чудовищно тяжкая по последствиям дилемма обнаруживается на заднем плане нашей проблемы. Ведь личность никогда не может развернуться, если человек не выберет — сознательно и с осознанным моральным решением — собственный путь. Не только каузальный мотив, необходимость, но также сознательное моральное решение должно дать свою силу процессу личностного развития. Если первое, т. е. необходимость, отсутствует, то так называемое развитие будет простой акробатикой воли; если отсутствует последнее, а именно сознательное решение, то развитие увязнет в тупом бессознательном автоматизме. Однако решиться на собственный путь можно только в том случае, если он представляется наилучшим выходом. Если бы лучшим считался какой-нибудь другой путь, то вместо пути, подобающего личности, проживался бы и вместе с тем развивался этот другой путь. Эти другие пути суть конвенции моральной, социальной, политической, философской и религиозной природы. Тот факт, что неизменно процветают конвенции какого-нибудь вида, доказывает, что подавляющее большинство людей выбирает не собственный путь, а конвенции, и вследствие этого каждый из них развивает не самого себя, а какой-нибудь метод, а значит, нечто коллективное за счет собственной целостности.На самом деле акция личностного развития — это, на взгляд постороннего, непопулярное предприятие, малоприятное уклонение от прямого пути, отшельническое оригинальничание. Поэтому неудивительно, что издавна лишь немногие додумывались до столь странной авантюры. Если бы все они были глупцами, то мы имели бы право исключить их из поля зрения нашего интереса как духовных \"частных лиц\". К несчастью, однако, личностями являются, как правило, легендарные герои человечества, те, кто вызывает восхищение, любовь и поклонение, истинные чада божьи, чьи имена \"не прейдут в эонах\". Они — подлинный цвет и плод, семена, порождающие древо рода человеческого.Ссылка на исторические личности уже объясняет, почему становление личностью является идеалом, упрек в индивидуализме — оскорблением. Величие исторической личности всегда состояло не в ее безоговорочном подчинении конвенции, но напротив, в спасительной для нее свободе от конвенции. Они как вершины гор возвышались над массой, которая цеплялась за коллективные страхи, убеждения, законы и методы, и выбирали собственную стезю. И заурядному человеку всегда представлялось диковинным, что некто вместо одного из проторенных путей и известных целей предпочитает крутую и узкую тропу, которая ведет в неизвестное. Поэтому такого человека всегда почитали если не помешанным, то одержимым демоном или богом; ибо это чудесное событие — некто сумел иначе сделать то, что издавна делало человечество, — можно объяснить не иначе как наделенностью демонической силой или божественным духом. Что же побуждает человека избрать собственный путь и таким образом вырваться, как из пелены тумана, из бессознательного тождества с массой?

Настоящая личность всегда имеет предназначение и верит в него; имеет к нему pistis, как к богу, хотя это — как, вероятно, сказал бы заурядный человек — всего лишь чувство индивидуального предназначения. Это предназначение действует, однако, как божественный закон, от которого невозможно уклониться. Тот факт, что очень многие погибают на собственном пути, ничего не значит для того, у кого есть предназначение. Он должен повиноваться собственному закону, как если бы это был демон, который соблазнял его новыми, странными путями. Кто имеет предназначение, кто слышит голос глубин, тот обречен. Поэтому, по преданию, он имеет личного демона, советы которого ему следует выполнять. Всем известный пример такого рода — Фауст, а исторический факт — даймон Сократа. Первобытные шаманы обладают духами змей, так же как Асклепий, покровитель врачей, которого в Эпидавре изображали в виде змеи. Кроме того, в качестве его личного демона выступал кабир Телесфор, который ему, видимо, читал вслух, т. е. внушал, рецепты.Первичный смысл выражения \"иметь предназначение\" гласит: быть вызванным неким голосом. Прекрасные тому примеры можно найти в свидетельствах ветхозаветных пророков. То, что это не просто архаичный facon de parler, доказывают исповеди исторических личностей — таких, как Гете и Наполеон (если ограничиться лишь двумя напрашивающимися примерами), которые не скрывали своего чувства предназначенности.Предназначение или чувство предназначенности — это прерогатива не только великих людей, но и обычных, вплоть до дюжинных; разница лишь в том, что вместе с убыванием величины предназначение становится все более туманным и бессознательным, словно голос внутреннего демона все больше и больше отдаляется, говорит все реже и невнятнее. Ведь чем меньше масштаб личности, тем в большей степени она неопределенна и бессознательна, пока, наконец, она не исчезает, становясь неотличимой от социальности и поступаясь из-за этого собственной целостностью, и взамен растворяется в целостности группы. Место внутреннего голоса заступает голос социальной группы и ее конвенций, а место предназначения — коллективные потребности. Однако многие, будучи в этом бессознательном социальном состоянии, откликаются на призыв индивидуального голоса, из-за чего тут же выделяются среди прочих и чувствуют себя поставленными перед проблемой, о которой другие не ведают. В большинстве случаев невозможно объяснить ближнему, что же случилось, потому что рассудок плотно замурован сильнейшими предрассудками. Неудобное отрицается, а нежелательное сублимируется, пугающее разъясняется, заблуждения исправляются — в итоге же считается, что теперь все отменно уладилось. При этом упускается главное, а именно, что психическое совпадает с сознанием и его фокусами лишь немного; гораздо большая его часть — это бессознательная данность, твердая и тяжелая, как несокрушимый и неподвижный гранит, который покоится, но может обрушиться на нас, как только это заблагорассудится неведомым законам. Гигантские катастрофы, которые угрожают нам, — это не стихийные события физической или биологической природы, а события психические. Нам в ужасающей мере грозят войны и революции, которые суть не что иное, как психические эпидемии. Во всякое время какая-нибудь химера может овладеть миллионами людей, и тогда вновь разразится либо мировая война, либо опустошительная революция. Вместо того, чтобы ждать опасности от диких зверей, обвалов и наводнений, человеку сегодня приходится опасаться стихийных сил своей психики. Психическое — это огромная сила, которая многократно превосходит все силы на свете. Просвещение, обезбожившее природу и человеческие установления, обошло своим вниманием только бога ужаса, который обитает в душе. Страх божий уместен более всего именно тут, перед лицом сверхмогущества психической стихии."},{"id":1806,"quote":"If ignorance alone, according to Gnostic orthodoxy, keeps humans tied to the material world, knowledge frees them from it.

Потому-то и в этом смысле тоже личность и ее своеобразный душевный склад не являются чем-то абсолютно неповторимым и единственным в своем роде. Неповторимость важна только для индивидуальности личности, как она важна для всякой индивидуальности. Стать личностью — это вовсе не прерогатива гениального человека. Да, он может быть гениальным, однако он не обязательно будет личностью. Поскольку каждый индивид имеет свой собственный, данный ему от рождения закон жизни, постольку у каждого есть теоретическая возможность следовать прежде всего этому закону и таким образом стать личностью, т. е. достичь целостности. Только тот, кто сознательно может сказать \"да\" силе предстающего перед ним внутреннего предназначения, становится личностью; тот же, кто ему уступает, становится добычей слепого потока событий и уничтожается. В том и состоит величие и искупительный подвиг всякой настоящей личности, что она добровольно приносит себя в жертву своему предназначению и осознанно переводит в свою индивидуальную действительность то, что могло бы привести только к погибели, продолжая жить бессознательною жизнью в группе.Один из блистательнейших примеров жизни и смысла личности, который нам сохранила история, — жизнь Христа. Антипод римской мании величия, которая была свойственна не только Цезарю, но и каждому римлянину — \"Я — гражданин Рима\", — возник в христианстве, которое, заметим между прочим, было единственной религией, действительно подвергавшейся преследованиям со стороны римлян. Противоречие обнаруживало себя везде, где бы ни сталкивались друг с другом культ цезарей и христианство. <...> Там, где весь еврейский народ ожидал в качестве мессии столь же имперского, сколь и политически всесильного героя, Христос выполнил мессианское предназначение не столько для своей нации, сколько для романского мира, и указал человечеству на древнюю истину: там, где господствует сила, нет любви, а там, где господствует любовь, сила не имеет значения. Религия любви была точной психологической контрмерой против римского шабаша силы.По-видимому, пример христианства лучше всего иллюстрирует мои предшествующие абстрактные доводы. Мнимо уникальная жизнь Христа стала священным символом потому, что она является психологическим прототипом единственного вида осмысленной жизни, а именно той жизни, которая устремлена к индивидуальному, т. е. абсолютному и безусловному осуществлению свойственного ей закона."},{"id":1862,"quote":"Should we will error?

По счастью, снисходительная и долготерпеливая природа никогда не вкладывала фатальный вопрос о смысле жизни в уста большинства людей. А если никто не спрашивает, не нужно и отвечать.Как великая личность оказывает социально разрешающее, избавляющее, преобразующее и целительное действие, так и рождение собственной личности обладает целительным воздействием на индивида, словно поток, затерявшейся в заросших илом притоках, вдруг снова нашел свое русло или убран прочь камень, лежавший на пускающем ростки семени, которое может теперь пуститься в рост.Голос глубин — это голос более полной жизни, более полного и объемного сознания. Поэтому в мифологическом смысле рождение героя или символическое возрождение совпадают с восходом солнца: ведь становление личности равнозначно приращению сознания. По этой причине большинство подобных героев обладают солнечными атрибутами, а момент рождения их великой личности называется просветлением.Конечно, смешно, когда голос всеблагой и всеразрушительной природы обличают в злодействе. Если она кажется нам преимущественно злой, то это идет главным образом от старой истины: лучшее — враг хорошего. Было бы глупо пренебрегать традиционным благом, пока это еще возможно. Но, как говорит Фауст: \"Мы достигаем на земле хорошего — и лучшее начинает означать обман и иллюзию\". Хорошее, к сожалению, не вечно остается хорошим, ибо иначе не было бы ничего лучшего. Если придет лучшее, то хорошее должно отступить. Потому-то Майстер Экхарт и говорит: \"Бог не хорош, ибо иначе он мог быть лучшим\".Поэтому в мировой истории бывают эпохи (к которым следовало бы причислить и нашу), когда доброе должно отступить, и тогда появляется то, что обречено стать лучшим, но поначалу считается злым. Насколько вообще опасно касаться этой проблемы, свидетельствует сказанное ранее; ведь как легко может одолеть зло, если просто заявить, будто оно как раз и есть потенциально лучшее! Проблематика внутреннего голоса полна скрытых ловушек и капканов. Это очень опасная и скользкая область, столь же опасная и шаткая, как и сама жизнь, если она отказывается от помочей. Кто, однако, не может поставить свою жизнь на кон, тот и не выиграет ее. Рождение и жизнь героя всегда под угрозой. Змеи Геры, угрожающие младенцу Гераклу, питон, который намеревается погубить Аполлона, бога света, при рождении, вифлеемское истребление младенцев — типичные примеры. Становление личности — это риск; и трагично, что именно демон внутреннего голоса означает одновременно и величайшую опасность, и необходимую помощь. Это трагично, но логично. Это естественно."},{"id":1866,"quote":"We shall not be digressing if we take this opportunity to try to grasp the psychological meaning of this rupture of the natural course of instinct, which is what the Christian process of sacrifice appears to be.

This is that every personification of the unconscious—the shadow, the anima, the animus, and the Self—has both a light and a dark aspect. We saw before that the shadow may be base or evil, an instinctive drive that one ought to overcome. It may, however, be an impulse toward growth that one should cultivate and follow. In the same way the anima and animus have dual aspects: They can bring life-giving development and creativeness to the personality, or they can cause petrification and physical death.

Indeed, it might well happen that however long he searched he would not find a single pebble weighing exactly 145 grams. The statistical method shows the facts in the light of the ideal average but does not give us a picture of their empirical reality. While reflecting an indisputable aspect of reality, it can falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way. This is particularly true of theories which are based on statistics.

All such roads, for him, lead in the wrong direction. He may not know it, but he behaves as if his own individual life were instinct with the will of God which must at all costs be fulfilled.

It is entirely the psychology of the youth who is entering life where the world consists mainly of men. There are female appendages who serve a certain purpose, for the propagation of the tribe or for the romantic feelings, but there is no other use for them.

It is by no means sure that one has either the power or the right to go to one's self, because this is a very great and difficult enterprise.

And also, has one the right to do it?\" For you might do it from a wrong motive; you might be really selfish-for example, if you are going to yourself in order to indulge in yourself and not to work.Jung, C.

That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interest upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the infinite, desires and attitudes change. In the final analysis, we count for something only because of the essential we embody, and if we do not embody that, life is wasted. In our relationships to other men, too, the crucial question is whether an element of boundlessness is expressed in the relationship.

On top of this, the various creeds assert quite different things, and each of them claims to possess the absolute truth. Yet today we live in a unitary world where distances are reckoned by hours and no longer by weeks and months. Exotic races have ceased to be peepshows in ethnological museums. They have become our neighbours, and what was yesterday the private concern of the ethnologist is today a political, social, and psychological problem. Already the ideological spheres begin to touch, to interpenetrate, and the time may not be far off when the question of mutual understanding will become acute. To make oneself understood is certainly impossible without far-reaching comprehension of the other’s standpoint. The insight needed for this will have repercussions on both sides.

If this were the case, a definite level of society, linked together by a similar education and environment and, therefore, correspondingly localized, would surely have a majority representation of such an attitude. But the actual facts are just the reverse, for the types have, apparently, quite a random distribution.

Endless repetition has engraved these experiences into our psychic constitution, not in the form of images filled with content, but at first only as forms without content, representing merely the possibility of a certain type of perception and action.

Grounds for such a conclusion are supplied by the phenomena of synchronicity, which are associated with the activity of unconscious operators and have hitherto been regarded, or repudiated, as 'telepathy' etc. Scepticism should, however, be levelled only at incorrect theories and not at facts which exist in their own right. No unbiased observer can deny them. Resistance to the recognition of such facts rests principally on the repugnance people feel for an allegedly supernatural faculty tacked on to the psyche, like 'clairvoyance'. The very diverse and confusing aspects of these phenomena are, so far as I can see at present, completely explicable on the assumption of psychically relative space-time continuum. As soon as the psychic content crosses the threshold of consciousness, the synchronistic marginal phenomena disappear, time and space resume their accustomed sway, and consciousness is once more isolated in its subjectivity. We have here one of those instances which can best be understood in terms of the physicist's idea of 'complementarity'. When an unconscious content passes over into consciousness its synchronistic manifestation ceases; conversely, synchronistic phenomena can be evoked by putting the subject into an unconscious state (trance)."},{"id":1982,"quote":"If I recognize only nat- uralistic values, and explain everything in physical terms, I shall depreciate, hinder, or even destroy the spiritual development of my patients.

Reason has proved itself completely powerless, precisely because its arguments have an effect only on the conscious mind and not on the unconscious.

Every mass organization is a latent danger just as much as a heap of dynamite is. It lets loose effects which no man wants and no man can stop. It is therefore in the highest degree desirable that a knowledge of psychology should spread so that men can understand the source of the supreme dangers that threaten them.

The chair upon which I am sitting and the house in which I am, have once been the imagination of a builder; first he made a drawing of it and then he built this house, and if it comes down on my head I shall be crushed.

How divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with light and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving ones. — This is a clear description of the Gothic cathedral where you really feel that life itself has become congealed-one could say it was congealed life. It is often compared to a wood or to the branches of a tree; all sorts of animals run up and down those columns and spires. It is wood that has become stone, or spirit that has become incorruptible matter, and the architecture symbolizes the struggle from which it arose. One sees the struggle itself represented in Norman art, in those manifold representations of the fight between man and monsters, particularly. In the Gothic cathedral this conflict is fully developed and fully represented in the enormous height and depth, in the light and the shadow, and in the extraordinary complication of all those architectural forms melting into each other, or fighting one another. It is also expressed in the peculiar arches built outside the church to support the walls inside; it gives one the idea of tremendous tension, of a thing that is almost bursting. When you look, for instance, in Notre Dame in Paris, at the tension of the walls inside supported by the arches, you realize how daring the whole enterprise was-to catch so much spirit in matterand what they had to do in order to secure it. There is no such thing in the Norman cathedrals; they are really made of stone, while in the Gothic cathedrals one begins to doubt the weight of the stone. And a little later one sees the same peculiarity in sculpture. In the cinquecento sculpture of Michelangelo and the later men, they seemed to deny the immobility of the stone; up to that time, stone had been practically immovable, even Greek sculpture, but with Michelangelo, the stone began to move with a surplus of life which is hardly believable. It seems as if it either were not stone or as if something wrong had happened. There is too much life, the stone seems to walk away. It begins to move till the whole thing falls asunder. You see, that is what Nietzsche is describing here. He calls them the divinely striving ones that are no longer striving; they have congealed, they have come to rest. Jung, C. G..

In establishing this inner “radio” reception, the anima takes on the role of guide, or mediator, to the world within and to the Self. That is how she appears in the example of the initiations of shamans that I described earlier; this is the role of Beatrice in Dante’s Paradiso, and also of the goddess Isis when she appeared in a dream to Apuleius, the famous author of The Golden Ass, in order to initiate him into a higher, more spiritual form of life.”"},{"id":2184,"quote":"Quem olha do lado de fora sonha; quem olha do lado de dentro desperta"},{"id":2185,"quote":"Niekada savęs nelaukiau tuo, kuris privalo rūpintis, kad vyšnios turėtų kotelius.

Six months later he \"stepped off into space.\" A mountain guide watched him and a friend letting themselves down a rope in a difficult place. The friend had found a temporary foothold on a ledge, and the dreamer was following him down. Suddenly he let go of the rope, according to the guide, \"as if he were jumping into the air.\" He fell upon his friend, and both went down and were killed.Another typical case was that of a lady who was living above herself. She was high and mighty in her daily life, but she had shocking dreams, reminding her of all sorts of unsavory things. When I uncovered them, she indignantly refused to acknowledge them. The dreams then became menacing, and full of references to the walks she used to take by herself in the woods, where she indulged in soulful fantasies. I saw her danger, but she would not listen to my many warnings. Soon afterwards, she was savagely attacked in the woods by a sexual pervert; but for the intervention of some people who heard her screams, she would have been killed.There was no magic in this.

For what is the body? The body is merely the visibility of the soul, the psyche; and the soul is the psychological experience of the body. So it is really one and the same thing. Therefore, a good truth must be true for the whole system, not only for half of it. According to my imagination, something seems to be good-it f-its in with my imagination-but it proves to be entirely wrong for my body.

The eye may well stand for consciousness (which is in fact an organ of perception), looking into its own background. It sees its own light there, and when this is clear and pure the whole body is filled with light. Under certain conditions consciousness has a purifying effect.

Both processes are seemingly outward, physical or metaphysical ones which in fact are inner, psychological ones. Both represent a progression from sheer ego consciousness to the ego’s rediscovery of the unconscious and reintegration with it to forge the self. In alchemy the progression is from base metals to the distillation of vapor out of them and the return of that vapor to the metals to form gold. In Gnosticism the progression is from the Gnostic’s sheer bodily existence to the release of the immaterial spark within the Gnostic’s body and the reunion of that spark with the godhead. In both cases the state truly sought lies within human beings—between the ego and the unconscious—rather than outside them—between the vapor and the metals or between the spark and the godhead.

Na důkaz této skutečnosti budiž uvedeno, že vztah mezi stvořitelem a stvořeným je dialektický a že člověk, jak zkušenost ukazuje, bývá nezřídka tím osloveným. Právem či neprávem z toho naivní rozum usuzuje na to, že vzniklý útvar existuje o sobě a pro sebe, a má sklon se domnívat, že jej nevytvořil sám, ale že se v něm tento útvar zobrazil - kteroužto možnost nemůže žádná kritika popřít, poněvadž vznik a vývoj tohoto útvaru (postavy) je finálně orientovaný přirozený proces, v němž příčina anticipuje cíl. Protože jde o přirozený jev, zůstává nerozhodnuto, zda je obraz boha vytvářen, nebo zda se tvoří sám. Naivní duch nemůže jinak, než vzít v úvahu jeho samostatnost a prakticky rozvinout jeho dialektickou vztaženost. To se projevuje v tom, že ve všech obtížných nebo nebezpečných situacích se tato účastná přítomnost vzývá za účelem, aby se obtížila nesnesitelně se jevícími těžkostmi a očekávala se od ní pomoc. V psychologické oblasti to znamená, že komplexy, které zatěžují duši, jsou vědomě \"přeneseny\" na obraz boha, což představuje pozoruhodným způsobem přímý opak aktu potlačení. Při potlačení, respektive vytěsnění jsou komplexy přenechávány nevědomé instanci tím, že člověk preferuje to, aby je zapomněl. U náboženského cvičení má však právě velký dosah to, že si zůstáváme svých potíží, tj. \"hříchů\" vědomi. Výborným prostředkem k tomu je vzájemné vyznávání hříchů (Jakub 5, 16), které člověku účinně brání, aby se stal nevědomým. Tato opatření směřují k udržení konfliktů ve vědomí, což je také conditio sine qua non psychoterapeutického postupu. Tak jako lékařské ošetření zapojuje osobu lékaře, tak křesťanské cvičení zapojuje Spasitele; neboť, jak se praví, \"V něm jsme vykoupeni jeho obětí a naše hříchy jsou nám odpuštěny\". On je ten, jenž nás zbavil naší viny a zpětně nás z ní vykoupil; Bůh, jenž stojí nad hříchem, \"On hřichu neučinil a v jeho ústech nebyla nalezena lest\"; \"On ,na svém těle vzal naše hříchy' na kříž...\" \"...tak i Kristus byl jen jednou obětován, aby na sebe vzal hříchy mnohých...\" Tento Bůh je charakterizován jako sám bez viny a jako ten, jenž se sám obětuje. Vědomá projekce, ke které směřuje křesťanská výchova, tím přináší dvojnásobné psychické dobrodiní. Za prvé si člověk udržuje vědomí existence konfliktu dvou protikladných tendencí a zabraňuje tím tomu, aby se potlačením, respektive vytěsněním a zapomněním stalo ze známého utrpení neznámé, a tím o to mučivější; a za druhé si člověk ulehčuje břímě tím, že je odevzdává Bohu, který zná všechna řešení. Božská postava je však nejprve psychickým obrazem, komplexem představ archetypické povahy, jež je vírou kladen jako identický s metafyzickým ens. Věda nemá žádnou kompetenci toto kladení posuzovat. Musí se naopak pokoušet provést své vysvětlení bez tohoto hypostazování. Může proto jen konstatovat, že na místo nějakého objektivního člověka nastupuje nějaká zdánlivě subjektivní postava, tj. komplex představ. Tento komplex má, jak ukazuje zkušenost, určitou funkční autonomii a projevuje se jako psychická existence. S ní má co do činění v první řadě psychologická zkušenost, a až potud může být tento zážitek také předmětem vědy. Ta může zjistit jen existenci psychických faktorů, a pokud nepřesahujeme přes tuto mez nějakou vírou, jsme ve všech takzvaných metafyzických otázkách konfrontováni výlučně s psychickými existencemi. Tyto jsou, jak právě odpovídá jejich psychické povaze, nejtěsněji spojeny s individuální osobností, a proto vystaveny všem možným variacím v protikladu k postulátu víry, jejíž stejnotvárnost a stálost je zaručena tradičně a institucionálně."},{"id":2383,"quote":"So far as we have any information about man, we know that he has always and everywhere been under the influence of dominating ideas.

Ve bu tür kötülükler yakın veya uzak geçmişte kaldıkları zaman, çabucak ve rahatça unutkanlık denizine gömülürler, arkasından ‘normallik’ dediğimiz o kronik bulanık kafalılık geri gelir. Oysa çarpıcı gerçeğe göre hiçbir şey yok olmamış, hiçbir şey düzelmemiştir. Kötülük, suç, vicdanın derin rahatsızlığı ve karanlık kuşkular gözlerimizin önündedir, keşke görmeyi bilseydik. Bunları yapan insandır; ben de insan doğasından nasibini almış bir insanım; demek ki başkalarının yanısıra ben de suçluyum ve bu kötülükleri tekrar tekrar yapabilme kapasitesini ve eğilimini içimde hiç değişmez ve silinmez biçimde taşıyorum. Hukuken konuşursak, suçun ortağı olmasak bile, insan tabiatımız yüzünden her zaman potansiyel suçlularız. Sadece o cehennem gibi meydan kavgasına sürüklenecek uygun ortamı bulamadık şimdiye dek. Hiçbirimiz insanlığın o kolektif kara gölgesinin dışında değiliz. Suç, nesiller önce işlenmiş olsa da, bugün işleniyor olsa da, her zaman ve her yerde olan bir eğilimin semptomu olmaya devam etmektedir. Dolayısıyla insan biraz ‘kötülüğü hayal etse’ iyi olurdu, zira ancak bir aptal kendi doğasının durumunu sürekli görmezden gelebilir. Gerçekten de, bu gaflet insanı kötülüğün aracı yapmanın en etkili yoludur. Zararsızlık ve naiflik, bir kolera hastası ile yakınlarının hastalığın bulaşıcılığından bihaber olmaları ne kadar işe yararsa, o kadar işe yarar. Aksine, zararsız ve naif olmak farkedilmeyen kötülüğün ‘ötekine’ yansıtılmasına yol açar. Bu da ötekinin pozisyonunu gayet etkin biçimde güçlendirir, çünkü yansıtma kendi içimizdeki kötülüğün gizlice ve gayri ihtiyari duyduğumuz korkuyu karşı tarafa taşır ve ondan gelecek tehlikenin boyutlarını arttırır. Daha da kötüsü, bu konudaki içgörü eksikliğimiz, kötülük ile başa çıkabilme kapasitemizi yok eder."},{"id":2392,"quote":"If dreams did nothing more than inform us about the causal factors in a neurosis, we could safely let the doctor handle them alone. My way of dealing with them, moreover, would be quite superfluous if all that we could expect of them were a collection of hints and insights helpful to the doctor. But since it is probable, as I have shown in a few examples, that dreams contain more than practical helps for the doctor, dream-analysis deserves very special consideration. Sometimes, indeed, it is a matter of life and death."},{"id":2393,"quote":"Only in the desert do we become aware of our terrible simple-mindedness, but we are afraid of admitting it."},{"id":2394,"quote":"What a terrifying thing it is to be yourself"},{"id":2395,"quote":"Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it."},{"id":2396,"quote":"A child, as I have said, possesses a sense of completeness, but only before the initial emergence of his ego-consciousness. In the case of an adult, a sense of completeness is achieved through a union of the consciousness with the unconscious contents of the mind. Out of this union arises what Jung called “the transcendent function of the psyche, by which a man can achieve his highest goal: the full realization of the potential of his individual Self.”"},{"id":2397,"quote":"Life has always seemed to me like a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its true life is invisible, hidden in the rhizome. The part that appears above ground lasts only a single summer. Then it withers away -an ephemeral apparition. When we think of the unending growth and decay of life and civilizations, we cannot escape the impression of absolute nullity. Yet I have never lost a sense of something that lives and endures underneath the eternal flux. What we see is the blossom, which passes. The rhizome remains.\" -Memories, Dreams, Reflections -Carl Gustav Jung"},{"id":2398,"quote":"No one should deny the danger of the descent, but it can be risked. No one need to risk it, but it is certain that someone will. And let those who go down the sunset way do so with open eyes, for it is a sacrifice which daunts even the gods. Yet every descent is followed by an ascent; the vanishing shapes are shaped anew, and a truth is valid in the end only if it suffers change and bears new witness in new images, in new tongues, like a new wine that is put into new bottles."},{"id":2399,"quote":"Who has vocation hears the voice of the inner man; he is called.

As nações fazem exatamente o que cada um faz individualmente; e do modo como o indivíduo age a nação também agirá.

Unii se eliberează pas cu pas, printr-o luptă continuă cu forțele nevăzute, din ghearele demonului, care îi forțează pe cei candizi să intre dintr-un destin brutal în altul; ceilalți se împotrivesc vehement și câștigă libertatea pentru ca mai târziu, prinși în capcana nevrozei, să fie readuși pe vechile lor cărări. Nimeni nu are voie să obiecteze că acești oameni nenorociți sunt pur și simplu nevrotici sau degenerați”. Dacă noi, cei normali, ne cercetăm viața, vedem și noi cum o mână puternică ne conduce implacabil spre anumite destine, și această mână nu poate fi numită întotdeauna una binevoitoare. Adesea, o numim mâna Domnului sau a diavolului și exprimăm astfel corect, în mod inconștient, un factor psihologic extrem de important, și anume faptul că acea compulsie care modelează viața psihicului nostru are caracterul unei personalități autonome, respectiv este percepută ca atare, astfel încât dintotdeauna și încă și în limbajul din ziua de azi sursa unor atare destine apare ca un demon, ca un spirit rău sau bun.”"},{"id":2407,"quote":"Dreams give information about the secrets of the inner life and reveal to the dreamer hidden factors of his personality."},{"id":2408,"quote":"Creativeness, like the freedom of the will, contains a secret.

Nevědomé imago, jemuž neodpovídá žádný objekt, se stává duchem mrtvého a má na subjekt účinky, které nelze chápat jinak než jako psychologické fenomény.
