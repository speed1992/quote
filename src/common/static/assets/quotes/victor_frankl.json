Sometimes man may be required simple to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task.

The gas chambers of Auschwitz were the ultimate consequence of the theory that man is nothing but the product of heredity and environment; or as the Nazi liked to say, ‘of Blood and Soil.’ I am absolutely convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Maidanek were ultimately prepared not in some Ministry or other in Berlin, but rather at the desks and lecture halls of nihilistic scientists and philosophers."},{"id":269,"quote":"It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness."},{"id":270,"quote":"The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity -even under the most difficult circumstances- to add a deeper meaning to his life.

Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone's task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed.

In German I described paradoxical intention as early as 1939.11 In this approach the phobic patient is invited to intend, even if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears. Let me recall a case. A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat. A week later he returned to report that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, “I only sweated out a quart before, but now I’m going to pour at least ten quarts!” The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently of it within one week. The reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the patient’s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety. Such a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor. This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied. At the same time, the patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. A statement consistent with this is found in Gordon W. Allport’s book, The Individual and His Religion: “The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.”12 Paradoxical intention is the empirical validation and clinical application of Allport’s statement.”"},{"id":404,"quote":"Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp’s tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism.

That unconditional meaning, however, is paralleled by the unconditional value of each and every person. It is that which warrants the indelible quality of the dignity of man. Just as life remains potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable, so too does the value of each and every person stay with him or her, and it does so because it is based on the values that he or she has realized in the past, and is not contingent on the usefulness that he or she may or may not retain in the present.More specifically, this usefulness is usually defined in terms of functioning for the benefit of society. But today's society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people who are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this difference and holds that na individual's value stems only from his present usefulness, then, believe me, one owes it only to personal inconsistency not to plead for euthanasia along the lines of Hitler's program, that is to say, \"mercy\" killing of all those who have lost their social usefulness, be it because of old age, incurable illness, mental deterioration, or whatever handicap they may suffer.Confounding the dignity of man with mere usefulness arises from a conceptual confusion that in turn may be traced back to the contemporary nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus and many an analytical couch. Even in the setting of training analyses such an indoctrination may take place. Nihilism does not contend that there is nothing, but it states that everything is meaningless. And George A. Sargent was right when he promulgated the concept of \"learned meaninglessness.\" He himself remembered a therapist who said, \"George, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There's no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.\"One must generalize such a criticism.

Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, \"homeostasis,\" i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is not homeostasis but what i call \"noo-dynamics,\" i.e., the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it. And one should not think that this holds true only for normal conditions; in neurotic individuals, it is even more valid. If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together.

This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being. At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal's behavior is imbedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like Paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism). A statistical survey recently revealed that amount my European students, 25 percent showed a more-or-less marked degree of existential vacuum. Among my American students it is not 25 but 60 percent.The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in leisure hours available to the average worker.

But Viktor Frankl chose to stay in his native Vienna after being freed and became head of neurology at a main hospital in Vienna. The Austrians he lived among often perplexed Frankl by saying they did not know a thing about the horrors of the camps he had barely survived. For Frankl, though, this alibi seemed flimsy. These people, he felt, had chosen not to know. Another survivor of the Nazis, the social psychologist Ervin Staub, was saved from a certain death by Raoul Wallenberg, the diplomat who made Swedish passports for thousands of desperate Hungarians, keeping them safe from the Nazis. Staub studied cruelty and hatred, and he found one of the roots of such evil to be the turning away, choosing not to see or know, of bystanders. That not-knowing was read by perpetrators as a tacit approval. But if instead witnesses spoke up in protest of evil, Staub saw, it made such acts more difficult for the evildoers. For Frankl, the “not-knowing he encountered in postwar Vienna was regarding the Nazi death camps scattered throughout that short-lived empire, and the obliviousness of Viennese citizens to the fate of their own neighbors who were imprisoned and died in those camps. The underlying motive for not-knowing, he points out, is to escape any sense of responsibility or guilt for those crimes. People in general, he saw, had been encouraged by their authoritarian rulers not to know—a fact of life today as well. That same plea of innocence, I had no idea, has contemporary resonance in the emergence of an intergenerational tension. Young people around the world are angry at older generations for leaving as a legacy to them a ruined planet, one where the momentum of environmental destruction will go on for decades, if not centuries. This environmental not-knowing has gone on for centuries, since the Industrial Revolution. Since then we have seen the invention of countless manufacturing platforms and processes, most all of which came to be in an era when we had no idea of their ecological impacts. Advances in science and technology are making ecological impacts more transparent, and so creating options that address the climate crisis and, hopefully, will be pursued across the globe and over generations. Such disruptive, truly “green” alternatives are one way to lessen the bleakness of Earth 2.0—the planet in future decades—a compelling fact of life for today’s young. Were Frankl with us today (he died in 1997), he would no doubt be pleased that so many of today’s younger people are choosing to know and are finding purpose and meaning in surfacing environmental facts and acting on them.”"},{"id":556,"quote":"نستطيع أن نكتشف معنى الحياة ب 3 طرق مختلفةبواسطة الإتيان بفعل و عملبواسطة أن نخبر قيمة من القيمبواسطة أن نعيش حالة من المعانا"},{"id":557,"quote":"(...)la logoterapia considera que la esencia de la existencia consiste en la capacidad del ser humano para responder responsablemente a las demandas que la vida le plantea en cada situación particular."},{"id":558,"quote":"الحب هو الطريقة الوحيدة التي يدرك بها الإنسان كائناً إنسانياً آخر في أعمق أغوار شخصيته. فلا يستطيع إنسان أن يصبح واعياً كل الوعي بالجوهر العميق لشخص آخر إلا إذا أحبه"},{"id":559,"quote":"The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.

Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. “Life” does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way.

[…] [Obsessive-compulsives] fear the potential effects or the potential cause of the strange thoughts. The phobic pattern of flight from fear is paralleled by the obsessive-compulsive pattern. Obsessive-compulsive neurotics also display fear. But theirs is not 'fear of fear' but rather fear of themselves, and their response is to fight against obsessions and compulsions. But the more the patients fight, the stronger their symptoms become. In other words, alongside the circle formation built up by anticipatory anxiety in phobic cases, there is another feedback mechanism which we encounter in the obsessive-compulsive neurotic.

There was little point in committing suicide, since, for the average inmate, life expectation, calculating objectively and counting all likely chances, was very poor. He could not with any assurance expect to be among the small percentage of men who survived all the selections. The prisoner of Auschwitz, in the first phase of shock, did not fear death. Even the gas chambers lost their horrors for him after the first few days—after all, they spared him the act of committing suicide.”"},{"id":657,"quote":"إنه لتصور خاطئ و خطير للصحة النفسية الزعم بأن ما يحتاجه الإنسان في المقام الأول هو ((التوازن))، أو كما يُعرف ب((إستعادة التوازن)) في البيولوجيا، أي ((حالة اللاتوتر)). فليس ما يحتاجه الإنسان حقيقةً هو حالة اللاتوتر و لكنه يحتاج إلى السعي و الإجتهاد في سبيل هدف يستحق أن يعيش من أجله. فالإنسان لا يحتاج إلى التخلص من التوتر بأي ثمن، و لكن يحتاج إلى إستدعاء إمكانات المعنى، ذلك المعنى الذي ينتظر أن يقوم بتحقيقه"},{"id":658,"quote":"Por lo tanto, lo que importa no es el sentido de la vida en formulaciones abstractas, sino el sentido concreto de la vida de un individuo en un momento determinado."},{"id":659,"quote":"The last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."},{"id":660,"quote":"Shortly before the United States entered World War II, I received an invitation to come to the American Consulate in Vienna to pick up my immigration visa.

Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size of human suffering is absolutely relative. It also follows that a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys. Take as an example something that happened on our journey from Auschwitz to the camp affiliated with Dachau. We had all been afraid that our transport was heading for the Mauthausen camp. We became more and more tense as we approached a certain bridge over the Danube which the train would have to cross to reach Mauthausen, according to the statement of experienced traveling companions. Those who have never seen anything similar cannot possibly imagine the dance of joy performed in the carriage by the prisoners when they saw that our transport was not crossing the bridge and was instead heading “only” for Dachau. And again, what happened on our arrival in that camp, after a journey lasting two days and three nights? There had not been enough room for everybody to crouch on the floor of the carriage at the same time. The majority of us had to stand all the way, while a few took turns at squatting on the scanty straw which was soaked with human urine. When we arrived the first important news that we heard from older prisoners was that this comparatively small camp (its population was 2,500) had no “oven,” no crematorium, no gas! That meant that a person who had become a “Moslem” could not be taken straight to the gas chamber, but would have to wait until a so-called “sick convoy” had been arranged to return to Auschwitz. This joyful surprise put us all in a good mood. The wish of the senior warden of our hut in Auschwitz had come true: we had come, as quickly as possible, to a camp which did not have a “chimney”—unlike Auschwitz. We laughed and cracked jokes in spite of, and during, all we had to go through in the next few hours.”"},{"id":899,"quote":"This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love.

У інших випадках краще скористатися з можливості споглядати й усвідомити свої активи: іноді людина повинна просто погодитися з долею, нести свій хрест. Коли людина виявляє, що їй призначено страждати, вона має сприйняти ці страждання як своє завдання, єдине та неповторне.

Certainly, it was a considerable achievement for a guard or foreman to be kind to the prisoners in spite of all the camp's influences, and, on the other hand, the baseness of a prisoner who treated his own companions badly was exceptionally contemptible. Obviously the prisoners found the lack of character in such men especially upsetting, while they were profoundly moved by the smallest kindness received from any of the guards...From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two- the \"race\" of the decent man and the \"race\" of the indecent man.

Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete. The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life.

Cuvintele lui Nietzsche - „Acela care are un de ce, va suporta orice cum - ar putea funcționa ca un motto după care să fie ghidate toate eforturile psihoterapeutice și psihoigienice în lucrul cu deținuții. Nu trebuia ratată nicio oportunitate de a furniza un de ce - un scop - existențial pentru a-i întări și a-i ajuta să suporte teribilul cum al vieții lor. Ce nenorocire pe capul celui care nu mai vedea un sens al vieții, nu mai avea nicio țintă, niciun scop și nu mai dorea, prin urmare, să continue. Acela era curând pierdut. Răspunsul tipic cu care prizonierul decepționat respingea orice argument de încurajare era: „Nu mai am ce să aștept de la viață”. Ce să-i spui unui om care crede asta?Ce ne trebuia nouă era de fapt o schimbare în atitudinea noastră față de viață. Trebuia să învățăm și, mai important, trebuia să-i învățăm pe cei ajunși la disperare, că nu conta cu adevărat ce așteptam noi de la viață, ci mai curând ce aștepta viața de la noi. Pentru asta era necesar că nu mai căutăm un sens al vieții, ci să ne percepem ca pe niște persoane pe care viața le ia la întrebări - zi de zi, oră de oră. Răspunsul nostri nu avea de-a face cu vorbitul și cu meditația, ci cu acțiunea și conduita corectă. În definitiv, viața înseamnă asumarea responsabilității identificării răspunsului corect la problemele pe care le ridică și îndeplinirea sarcinilor cu care ne provoacă existența.Sarcinile, și implicit, sensul vieții, diferă de la om la om, de la moment la moment. De aceea, e imposibil să formulezi o definiție generală a sensului vieții. Întrebările legate de sensul vieții nu pot fi rezolvate cu declarații generaliste. „Viața” nu e ceva vag, ci ceva foarte real și concret, așa cum și sarcinile vieții sunt cât se poate de reale și concrete. Acestea compun destinul unui om, diferit și unic pentru fiecare individ. Niciun om și niciun destin nu pot fi comparate. Nicio situație nu se repetă și fiecare situație solicită un răspuns diferit. Există și situații de viață care solicită o modificare a destinului prin acțiune conștientă. Alteori e mai avantajos să folosești o oportunitate pentru a contempla lucrurile și pentru a deveni mai bogat în sensul acesta. Iar uneori ni se cere pur și simplu să ne acceptăm soarta și să ne ducem crucea. Orice situație este unică și orice problemă are un singur răspuns corect.Un om care descoperă că destinul său este suferința, va trebui să accepte suferința ca pe o sarcină; sarcina lui singulară și unică. Va trebui să conștientizeze faptul că până și în suferința sa este unic și singur în univers.

In ogni situazione, l’uomo è chiamato a un diverso comportamento. La sua situazione concreta pretende talora ch’egli agisca, che cerchi dunque di plasmare attivamente il suo destino, talaltra che sfrutti un’occasione, sperimentando (o godendo) possibili valori da realizzare; spesso si pretende dall’uomo ch’egli sopporti con semplicità il suo destino, la “sua croce, come abbiamo detto. Sempre, però, ogni situazione è caratterizzata dall’unicità e originalità che, di volta in volta, permette solo “una” risposta, ed essa sola; per l’appunto, la “risposta esatta” alla domanda insita nella situazione concreta. Qualora il destino concreto infligga all’uomo un dolore, egli dovrà vedere anche nel dolore un compito, anch’esso unico. Persino di fronte al dolore, l’uomo deve giungere alla consapevolezza di essere unico e originale, per così dire, in tutto l’universo, con questo suo destino di dolore. Nessuno glielo può togliere, nessuno può assumere questa sofferenza in vece sua. La possibilità di una prestazione originale sta proprio nel “come” l’individuo colpito da questo destino sopporta la sua sofferenza.”"},{"id":1488,"quote":"Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why—an aim—for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence."},{"id":1489,"quote":"logotherapy, in comparison with psychoanalysis, is a method less retrospective and less introspective.

There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one’s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.

F., el jefe de mi barracón, compositor y libretista famoso, me confió un día: «Me gustaría contarle algo, doctor. He tenido un extraño sueño. Una voz me invitaba a desear cualquier cosa, bastaba con preguntar lo que quería conocer y mis preguntas serían satisfechas de inmediato. ¿Sabe qué pregunté? Cuándo terminaría la guerra para mí. Ya sabe lo que quiero decir, doctor, ¡para mí! Conocer cuándo seríamos liberados los de este campo y cuándo terminarían nuestros sufrimientos». «¿Y cuándo tuvo usted ese sueño?», le pregunté. «En febrero de 1945», contestó. Por entonces estábamos a principios de marzo. «¿Qué respondió la voz en su sueño?» En voz baja, casi furtivamente, me susurró: «El treinta de marzo.» Cuando F. me contó aquel sueño todavía se encontraba rebosante de esperanza y convencido de la certeza y veracidad del oráculo de la voz. Sin embargo, a medida que se acercaba el día prometido, las noticias que recibíamos sobre la guerra menguaban las esperanzas de ser liberados en la fecha indicada. El veintinueve de marzo, de repente, F. cayó enfermo con una fiebre muy alta. El treinta de marzo, el día en que según su profecía terminaría la guerra y el sufrimiento para él, empezó a delirar y perdió la conciencia. El treinta y uno de marzo falleció. Según todas las apariencias murió de tifus... Los que conocen la estrecha relación entre el estado de ánimo de una persona su valor y su esperanza, o su falta de ambos y el estado de su sistema inmunológico comprenderán cómo la pérdida repentina de la esperanza y el valor pueden desencadenar un desenlace mortal. La causa última de la muerte de mi amigo fue la honda decepción que le produjo no ser liberado en el día señalado. De pronto se debilitó la resistencia de su organismo y sus defensas disminuyeron, dejándole a merced de la infección tifoidea latente. Su esperanza en el futuro y su voluntad de vivir se paralizaron, y su cuerpo sucumbió víctima de la enfermedad. Después de todo, la voz de sus sueños se hizo realidad. La observación de este caso, y sus consecuencias psicológicas, concuerda con un hecho que el médico del campo me hizo notar: la tasa de mortandad semanal durante las Navidades de 1944 y el Año Nuevo de 1945 superó en mucho las estadísticas habituales del campo. En su opinión, la explicación de este aumento de mortalidad no había que buscarla en el empeoramiento de las condiciones de trabajo, ni en una disminución de la ración alimenticia, ni en un cambio climatológico, ni en el brote de nuevas epidemias. A su entender, se trataba sencillamente de la ingenua esperanza que abrigaron la mayoría de los presos de ser liberados por las fiestas navideñas. Según se acercaba esa fecha, y al no recibir ninguna noticia alentadora, los prisioneros perdieron su valor y les venció el desaliento.

I would strictly deny that one's search or a meaning to his existence, or even his doubt of it, in every case is derived from, or results in, any disease. Existential frustration is neither pathological or pathogenic. A man's concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. it may well be that interpreting the first in terms of the latter motivates a doctor to bury his patient's existential despair under a heap of tranquilizing drugs. It is his task, rather, to pilot the patient through his existential crises of growth and development. Logotherapy regards its assignment as that of assisting the patient to find meaning in his life. Inasmuch as logotherapy makes him aware of the hidden logos of his existence, it is an analytical process. To this extent, logotherapy resembles psychoanalysis. However, in logotherapy's attempt to make something conscious again it does not restrict its activity to instinctual facts within the individual's unconscious bu also cares for existential realities, such as the potential meaning of his existence to be fulfilled as well as his will to meaning. Any analysis, however, even when it refrains from including the noological dimension in its therapeutic process, tries to make the patient aware of what he actually longs for in the depth of his being. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflict claims of id, ego and supergo, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment."},{"id":1803,"quote":"From this one may see that there is no reason to pity old people.

On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way-by applying paradoxical intention-the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies. In the fortunate case where there is no existential vacuum which invites and elicits the symptom, the patient will not only succeed in ridiculing his neurotic fear but finally will succeed in completely ignoring it."},{"id":1823,"quote":"proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."},{"id":1824,"quote":"What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment."},{"id":1825,"quote":"In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way —an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment."},{"id":1826,"quote":"Să revenim la chestiunea propriu-zisă a sensului.

Dar cum rămâne cu libertatea umană? Omul nu-și păstrează libertatea spirituală de conduită și reacție la mediu? Să fie adevărată teoria conform căreia omul este doar produsul multor factori de mediu și al condiționărilor - fie ele biologice, psihologice sau sociologice? Omul este doar produsul accidental al acestora? Și, mai important, reacțiile prizonierilor în universul unic al lagărului de concentrare reprezintă o dovadă că omul nu poate scăpa de influența mediului? Că nu avem libertatea unor opțiuni când ne aflăm în situații de tipul acesta?Acestor întrebări le putem răspunde atât din experiență, cât și din principiu. Experiența din lagăr demonstrează că omul are capacitate de decizie asupra conduitei sale. Există suficiente exemple, adesea de natură eroică, care arată că apatia poate fi depăsită și iritabilitatea, suprimată. Omul își poate conserva o urmă de libertate spirituală, de independență a minții, chiar și în condiții de stres psihic și fizic teribil.Noi, cei care am trecut prin lagăre, ne amintim de cei care mergeau din baracă în baracă ca să-i consoleze pe ceilalți, oferindu-le și ultimul lor colț de pâine. Poate că nu au fost numeroși, dar existența lor atestă faptul că un om poate să piardă orice, în afară de un singur lucru: ultima dintre libertățile umane - alegerea răspunsului în orice situație, alegerea felului propriu de a reacționa.Iar de decizii ne loveam mereu. Orice zi și orice oră din zi ne punea în fața unei decizii, decizia de a ne conforma sau nu forțelor care amenințau să ne vitregească de sentimentul individualității și al libertății interioare, care determinau dacă suntem sau nu doar o jucărie a circumstanțelor, decizia de a renunța la libertate și demnitate pentru a fi modelați în forma tipică a deținutului.Privind din perspectiva asta, reacțiile mentale ale prizonierilor din lagărele de concentrare nu pot fi reduse la expresia condițiilor fizice și sociale. Deși lipsa somnului, a hranei și diferitele surse de stres mental ar putea sugera că prizonierii erau înclinați spre anumite tipuri de răspuns, la o analiză finală devine limpede că prizonierul se transforma pe sine mai degrabă pornind de la o decizie interioară, nu doar din pricina influenței condițiilor de viață din prizonierat. Prin urmare, și în aceste condiții, orice om este liber să decidă ce vrea să devină - mental și spiritual. Dostoievski a spus cândva, „Un singur lucru mă înspăimântă: să nu mă ridic la înălțimea suferințelor mele. Mi-am amintit de multe ori cuvintele sale când i-am întâlnit pe martirii lagărelor, pe cei al căror comportament, suferință și moarte stau mărturie că omul nu poate fi jefuit de libertatea lui interioară. Despre aceștia putem spune că s-au ridicat la înălțimea suferinței lor; că felul în care și-au dus crucea a fost cu adevărat o victorie interioară. Tocmai această libertate interioară - ce nu-i poate fi luată niciunui om - conferă sens și rost vieții.”"},{"id":1904,"quote":"According to logotheraphy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering"},{"id":1905,"quote":"One of the prisoners, who on his arrival marched with a long column of new inmates from the station to the camp, told me later that he had felt as though he were marching at his own funeral.

In reality there are only two races, namely the \"race\" of decent people and the \"race\" of people who are not decent.

Even in the concentration camps one came across halfway decent fellows here and there among the SS men-just as one came across the odd scoundrel or two among the prisoners. not to mention the Capos. That decent people are in the minority, that they have always been a minority and are likely to remain so is something we must come to terms with. Danger only threatens when a political system sends those not-decent people, i.e., the negative element of a nation, to the top. And no nation is immune from doing this, and in this respect every nation is in principle capable of a Holocaust! In support of this we have the sensational results of scientific experiments in the field of social psychology, for which we owe thanks to an American; they are known as the Milgram Experiment. If we want to extract the political consequences from all this, we should assume that there are basically only two styles of politics, or perhaps better said, only two types of politicians: the first are those believe that the end justifies the means, and that could be any means...While the other type of politician knows very well that there are mans that could desecrate the holiest end. And it is this type of politician whom I trust, despite the clamor around the year 1988, and the demands of the day, not to mention of the anniversary, trust to hear the voice of reason and to ensure that all who are of goodwill, stretch out their hands to each other, across all the graves and across all divisions."},{"id":1913,"quote":"Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.

Dar și viața lipsită de creație sau de plăcerea contemplării creației poate avea sens, când e îndreptată spre un comportament moral unic: e vorba despre atitudinea omului față de existență, când aceasta e limitată de forțe exterioare.

Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. “Life” does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action.

Just consider the mass neurotic syndrome so pervasive in the young generation: there is ample empirical evidence that the three facets of this syndrome-depression, aggression, addiction-are due to what is called in logotherapy \"the existential vacuum,\" a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness. It goes without saying that not each and every case of depression is to be traced back to a feeling of meaninglessness, nor does suicide-in which depression sometimes eventuates-always result from an existential vacuum. But even if each and every case of suicide had not been undertaken out of a feeling of meaninglessness, it may well be that na individual's impulse to take his life would have been overcome had he been aware of some meaning and purpose worth living for.

He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph. Again it was Edith Weisskopf-Joelson who, as mentioned, once expressed the hope that logotherapy “may help counteract certain unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, where the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading” so that “he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.”"},{"id":2035,"quote":"three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times."},{"id":2036,"quote":"LA PREGUNTA POR EL SENTIDO DE LA VIDA Lo que de verdad necesitamos es un cambio radical en nuestra actitud frente a la vida.
