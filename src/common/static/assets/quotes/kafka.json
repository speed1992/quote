To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. 'It is possible,' answers the doorkeeper, 'but not at this moment.' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs and says: 'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other. Even the third of these has an aspect that even I cannot bear to look at.' These are difficulties which the man from the country has not expected to meet, the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man and at all times, but when he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his furred robe, with his huge pointed nose and long, thin, Tartar beard, he decides that he had better wait until he gets permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. There he sits waiting for days and years. He makes many attempts to be allowed in and wearies the doorkeeper with his importunity. The doorkeeper often engages him in brief conversation, asking him about his home and about other matters, but the questions are put quite impersonally, as great men put questions, and always conclude with the statement that the man cannot be allowed to enter yet. The man, who has equipped himself with many things for his journey, parts with all he has, however valuable, in the hope of bribing the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts it all, saying, however, as he takes each gift: 'I take this only to keep you from feeling that you have left something undone.' During all these long years the man watches the doorkeeper almost incessantly. He forgets about the other doorkeepers, and this one seems to him the only barrier between himself and the Law. In the first years he curses his evil fate aloud; later, as he grows old, he only mutters to himself. He grows childish, and since in his prolonged watch he has learned to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar, he begs the very fleas to help him and to persuade the doorkeeper to change his mind. Finally his eyes grow dim and he does not know whether the world is really darkening around him or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. But in the darkness he can now perceive a radiance that streams immortally from the door of the Law. Now his life is drawing to a close. Before he dies, all that he has experienced during the whole time of his sojourn condenses in his mind into one question, which he has never yet put to the doorkeeper. He beckons the doorkeeper, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend far down to hear him, for the difference in size between them has increased very much to the man's disadvantage. 'What do you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'you are insatiable.' 'Everyone strives to attain the Law,' answers the man, 'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is at the end of his strength and that his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: 'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended only for you.

It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break — as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps.

Writing that springs from the surface of existence— when there is no other way and the deeper wells have dried up—is nothing, and collapses the moment a truer emotion makes that surface shake.

This is why there is never enough time at one’s disposal, for the roads are long and it is easy to go astray, there are even times when one becomes afraid and has the desire—even without any constraint or enticement—to run back (a desire always severely punished later on), how much more so if one were suddenly to receive a kiss from the most beloved lips!

I would then return to my table, eat slowly and with deliberation, then start writing again at once. And how I would write! From what depths I would drag it up! Without effort! For extreme concentration knows no effort.

En realidad no tengo que disculparme de mi silencio, usted ya sabe cómo odio las cartas. Toda la desdicha de mi vida – no quiero con esto quejarme, sino hacer una observación de interés general- proviene por así decir de las cartas o de la posibilidad de escribirlas. Las personas casi nunca me han traicionado, pero las cartas siempre, y en verdad no las ajenas, sino justamente las mías. En mi caso es una desgracia muy especial, de la que no quiero seguir hablando, pero al mismo tiempo es una desgracia también general. La sencilla posibilidad de escribir cartas debe de haber provocado -desde un punto de vista meramente teórico- una terrible desintegración de almas en el mundo. Es en efecto una conversación con fantasmas ( y para peor no sólo con el fantasma del destinatario, sino también con el del remitente) que se desarrolla entre líneas en la carta que uno escribe, o aun en una serie de cartas, donde cada una corrobora la otra y puede referirse a ella como testigo. ¿De dónde habrá surgido la idea de que las personas podían comunicarse mediante cartas? Se puede pensar en una persona distante, se puede aferrar a una persona cercana, todo lo demás queda más allá de las fuerzas humanas. Escribir cartas, sin embargo, significa desnudarse ante los fantasmas, que lo esperan ávidamente. Los besos por escrito no llegan a su destino, se los beben por el camino los fantasmas. Con este abundante alimento se multiplican, en efecto, enormemente. La humanidad lo percibe y lucha por evitarlo; y para eliminar en lo posible lo fantasmal entre las personas y lograr una comunicación natural, que es la paz de las almas, ha inventado el ferrocarril, el automóvil, el aeroplano, pero ya no sirven, son evidentemente descubrimientos hechos en el momento del desastre, el bando opuesto es tanto más calmo y poderoso, después del correo inventó el telégrafo, el teléfono, la telegrafía sin hilos. Los fantasmas no se morirán de hambre, y nosotros en cambio pereceremos."},{"id":1025,"quote":"13 September. Again barely two pages.

The thoughts provoked in me by the war resemble my old worries over F. in the tormenting way in which they devour me from every direction. I can’t endure worry, and perhaps have been created expressly in order to die of it.

At inns and in places like that it may serve a useful purpose, along the lines, say, of an automated phonograph, but that’s all. Have you ever telephoned here, you have? Well then, perhaps you can understand me. At the Castle the telephone seems to work extremely well; I’ve been told the telephones up there are in constant use, which of course greatly speeds up the work. Here on our local telephones we hear that constant telephoning as a murmuring and singing, you must have heard it too. Well, this murmuring and singing is the only true and reliable thing that the local telephones convey to us, everything else is deceptive. There is no separate telephone connection to the Castle and no switchboard to forward our calls; when anyone here calls the Castle, all the telephones in the lowest-level departments ring, or all would ring if the ringing mechanism on nearly all of them were not, and I know this for certain, disconnected. Now and then, though, an overtired official needs some diversion—especially late in the evening or at night—and turns on the ringing mechanism, then we get an answer, though an answer that’s no more than a joke. That’s certainly quite understandable. For who can claim to have the right, simply because of some petty personal concerns, to ring during the most important work, conducted, as always, at a furious pace? Nor can I understand how even a stranger can believe that if he calls Sordini, for instance, it really is Sordini who answers. Quite the contrary, it’s probably a lowly filing clerk from an entirely different department. But it can happen, if only at the most auspicious moment, that someone telephones the lowly filing clerk and Sordini himself answers.

Zawsze starałem się znaleźć na Twoje urodziny coś, co wskutek swej obojętności nie zmieniałoby się, nie gubiło, nie psuło i nie mogło być zapomniane. A dumając potem miesiącami, znów nie widziałem innego ratunku, niż wysłać Ci książkę. Z książkami jest jednak utrapienie, z jednej strony są obojętne, a potem znów z drugiej o tyle bardziej interesujące, potem zaś pociągnęło mnie do tych obojętnych tylko przekonanie, które bynajmniej nic we mnie nie rozstrzygnęło, w końcu zaś, ciągle jeszcze z odmiennym przekonaniem, trzymałem w ręku książkę, która paliła tak tylko z ciekawości. Kiedyś nawet z rozmysłem zapomniałem o Twoich urodzinach, co było wszak lepsze niż posłanie książki, ale dobre nie było. Dlatego wysyłam Ci teraz ten kamyczek i będę Ci go wysyłał póki naszego życia. Będziesz go trzymać w kieszeni, ochroni Cię, wsadzisz do szuflady, również nie będzie bezczynny, ale jeśli go wyrzucisz, będzie najlepiej. Bo wiesz, Maksie, moja miłość do Ciebie jest większa niż ja sam i bardziej ja w niej mieszkam niż ona we mnie, i ma też kiepską podporę w mojej niepewnej istocie, tym sposobem jednak dostanie w kamyczku skalne mieszkanie i niechby to było tylko w szczelinie bruku na Schalengasse. Od dawna już ratowała mnie ona częściej niż sądzisz, a właśnie teraz, gdy wiem o sobie mniej niż kiedykolwiek i odczuwam siebie z pełną świadomością jedynie w półśnie, tylko tak nadzwyczaj lekko, tylko teraz jeszcze - krążę tak niczym z czarnymi wnętrznościami - dobrze zatem zrobi ciśnięcie w świat takiego kamyka i oddzielenie w ten sposób pewnego od niepewnego. Czym są wobec tego książki! Książka zaczyna Cię nudzić i już nie przestanie albo porwie ją twoje dziecko, albo, jak ta książka Walsera, rozlatuje się już, kiedy ją dostajesz. Przy kamyku przeciwnie, nic nie może Cię znudzić, taki kamyk nie może też ulec zniszczeniu, a jeśli już, to dopiero po długim czasie, także zapomnieć go nie można, ponieważ nie masz obowiązku o nim pamiętać, w końcu nie możesz go też nigdy ostatecznie zgubić, gdyż na pierwszej lepszej żwirowej drodze znajdziesz go z powrotem, bo jest to właśnie pierwszy lepszy kamyk. A jeszcze nie mógłbym mu zaszkodzić większą pochwałą, szkody z pochwał powstają bowiem tylko wtedy, gdy pochwała chwaloną rzecz rozgniata, niszczy lub zapodziewa. Ale kamyczek? Krótko mówiąc, wyszukałem Ci najpiękniejszy prezent urodzinowy i przekazuję Ci go z pocałunkiem, który ma wyrażać niezdarne podziękowanie za to, ze jesteś."},{"id":1232,"quote":"leoparzi patrund in Templu si beau din vasele de sacrificiu. evenimentul are loc din nou si din nou. pana la urma devine predictibil. devine parte a ceremoniei."},{"id":1233,"quote":"Superstição, princípios e meios de tornarmos a vida possível:Ganhamos o inferno da virtude passando pelo céu dos vícios.

Pero el guardián responde que en ese momento no le puede franquear el acceso. El hombre reflexiona y luego pregunta si es que podrá entrar más tarde. —Es posible —dice el guardián—, pero ahora, no. Las puertas de la Ley están abiertas, como siempre, y el guardián se ha hecho a un lado, de modo que el hombre se inclina para atisbar el interior. Cuando el guardián lo advierte, ríe y dice: —Si tanto te atrae, intenta entrar a pesar de mi prohibición. Pero recuerda esto: yo soy poderoso. Y yo soy sólo el último de los guardianes. De sala en sala irás encontrando guardianes cada vez más poderosos. Ni siquiera yo puedo soportar la sola vista del tercero. El campesino no había previsto semejantes dificultades. Después de todo, la Ley debería ser accesible a todos y en todo momento, piensa. Pero cuando mira con más detenimiento al guardián, con su largo abrigo de pieles, su gran nariz puntiaguda, la larga y negra barba de tártaro, se decide a esperar hasta que él le conceda el permiso para entrar. El guardián le da un banquillo y le permite sentarse al lado de la puerta. Allí permanece el hombre días y años. Muchas veces intenta entrar e importuna al guardián con sus ruegos. El guardián le formula, con frecuencia, pequeños interrogatorios. Le pregunta acerca de su terruño y de muchas otras cosas; pero son preguntas indiferentes, como las de los grandes señores, y al final le repite siempre que aún no lo puede dejar entrar. El hombre, que estaba bien provisto para el viaje, invierte todo —hasta lo más valioso— en sobornar al guardián. Este acepta todo, pero siempre repite lo mismo: —Lo acepto para que no creas que has omitido algún esfuerzo. Durante todos esos años, el hombre observa ininterrumpidamente al guardián. Olvida a todos los demás guardianes y aquél le parece ser el único obstáculo que se opone a su acceso a la Ley. Durante los primeros años maldice su suerte en voz alta, sin reparar en nada; cuando envejece, ya sólo murmura como para sí. Se vuelve pueril, y como en esos años que ha consagrado al estudio del guardián ha llegado a conocer hasta las pulgas de su cuello de pieles, también suplica a las pulgas que lo ayuden a persuadir al guardián. Finalmente su vista se debilita y ya no sabe si en la realidad está oscureciendo a su alrededor o si lo engañan los ojos. Pero en aquellas penumbras descubre un resplandor inextinguible que emerge de las puertas de la Ley. Ya no le resta mucha vida. Antes de morir resume todas las experiencias de aquellos años en una pregunta, que nunca había formulado al guardián. Le hace una seña para que se aproxime, pues su cuerpo rígido ya no le permite incorporarse. El guardián se ve obligado a inclinarse mucho, porque las diferencias de estatura se han acentuado señaladamente con el tiempo, en desmedro del campesino. —¿Qué quieres saber ahora? –pregunta el guardián—. Eres insaciable. —Todos buscan la Ley –dice el hombre—. ¿Y cómo es que en todos los años que llevo aquí, nadie más que yo ha solicitado permiso para llegar a ella? El guardián comprende que el hombre está a punto de expirar y le grita, para que sus oídos debilitados perciban las palabras. —Nadie más podía entrar por aquí, porque esta entrada estaba destinada a ti solamente.

Zij kon hem niet dadelijk vinden, maar toen zij hem onder de canapé ontdekte - God, hij moest toch érgens zijn, hij had toch niet kunnen wegvliegen - , schrok zij zo, dat zij, zonder zich te kunnen beheersen, de deur van buitenaf weer dichtsloeg. Maar alsof zij berouw had van haar handelwijze, deed zij de deur meteen weer open en kwam, als ging het om een ernstige zieke of zelfs een vreemde, op haar tenen binnen. Gregor had zijn kop tot vlak aan de rand van de canapé naar voren geschoven en observeerde haar. Of zij wel zou merken dat hij de melk had laten staan, en wel allerminst uit gebrek aan eetlust, en of zij ander voedsel zou komen brengen, dat meer aan zijn wensen tegemoet kwam? Als zij het niet uit zichzelf deed wilde hij liever verhongeren dan haar erop attent te maken, hoewel hij eigenlijk een geweldige aandrang voelde om onder de canapé vandaan te schieten, zich aan zijn zusters voeten te werpen en haar om wat lekker eten te smeken. Maar zijn zuster zag dadelijk tot haar verbazing de nog volle kom, waaruit alleen rondom een beetje melk was gemorst, zij nam hem meteen op, weliswaar niet met haar blote handen maar met een lap, en droeg hem de kamer uit. Gregor was uiterst nieuwsgierig wat zij ter vervanging zou brengen en hij maakte zich daar de meest uiteenlopende voorstellingen van. Nooit had hij echter kunnen raden wat zijn zuster in haar goedheid werkelijk deed. Zij bracht hem, om zijn smaak te onderzoeken, een hele keur aan spijzen, op een oude krant uitgespreid. Er was oude, half verrotte groente; botten van het avondeten in een gestolde witte saus, wat rozijnen en amandelen; een kaas die Gregor twee dagen tevoren oneetbaar had verklaard; een stuk droog brood, een met boter besmeerd stuk brood en een met boter besmeerd en gezouten stuk brood.

What else can happen but that the two worlds split apart, and they do split apart, or at least clash in a fearful manner. There are doubtless several reasons for the wild tempo of the inner process; the most obvious one is introspection, which will suffer no idea to sink tranquilly to rest but must pursue each one into consciousness, only itself to become an idea, in turn to be pursued by renewed introspection. Secondly: this pursuit, originating in the midst of men, carries one in a direction away from them. The solitude that for the most part has been forced on me, in part voluntarily sought by me –but what was this if not compulsion too? –is now losing all its ambiguity and approaches its dénouement. Where is it leading? The strongest likelihood is, that it may lead to madness; there is nothing more to say, the pursuit goes right through me and rends me asunder. Or I can –can I? –manage to keep my feet somewhat and be carried along in the wild pursuit. Where, then, shall I be brought? ‘Pursuit,’ indeed, is only a metaphor.

But in that case why build the actual wall, which after all was something concrete, the result of the lifelong labor of multitudes of people? And why were there in the book plans, somewhat nebulous plans, it must be admitted, of the tower, and proposals worked out in detail for mobilizing the people's energies for the stupendous new work? There were many wild ideas in people's heads at that time -- this scholar's book is only one example -- perhaps simply because so many were trying to join forces as far as they could for the achievement of a single aim.
