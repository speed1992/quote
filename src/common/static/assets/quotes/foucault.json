Skoro nielegalne przejawy seksualności trzeba jakoś umiejscowić, niech sobie broją gdzie indziej - tam gdzie można by je wpisać w sferę jeśli nie produkcji, to przynajmniej zysku. Dom schadzek i dom bez klamek okażą się przybytkami tolerancji: prostytutka ze swym klientem i sutenerem, psychiatra ze swym histerykiem - Stephen Marcus nazwałby ich ” innymi wiktorianami” - potrafili, jak się wydaje, chytrze wprowadzić przemilczaną rozkosz w sferę praw branych w rachubę; cichaczem zaakceptowane słowa i gesty podlegają tam wymianie po odpowiednich cenach. Tylko tam dziki seks może przybierać realne kształty, ściśle co prawda wyizolowane, i prowadzić sekretne dyskursy, ograniczone w zasięgu, stosujące własny kod. Wszędzie indziej panuje nowoczesny purytanizm i jego potrójny dekret o zakazie, nieistnieniu i niemocie. Czyżbyśmy uwolnili się wreszcie od patronatu dwóch długich stuleci, kiedy historię seksualności należało odczytywać przede wszystkim jako kronikę narastającej represji? Tyle, o ile, powiadają. Może dzięki Freudowi. Z jaką jednak ostrożnością, lekarską rozwagą, naukową gwarancją nieszkodliwości, i z jaką dbałością o zachowanie wszystkiego, bez obawy “naruszenia” bezpiecznej i dyskretnej przestrzeni pomiędzy kanapą a dyskursem: intratny szept wciąż jeszcze dochodzi do łóżka.”"},{"id":463,"quote":"Mais surtout, alors qu’en 1955 Foucault confrontait finalement des « expériences de pensée », en 1966-1968 la terminologie sera celle des « discours » : ce sont les « mutations du discours philosophique » qui seront étudiées."},{"id":464,"quote":"… only that which never ceases to hurt stays in the memory."},{"id":465,"quote":"Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior edge, the line of dissolution, the contour against the void.

A supplementary code was needed that complements this law and gets it to work: the worker himself had to be moralized. When he is told: “You are only your labor-power and I have paid the market price for it,”‡ and when so much wealth is put in his hands, it is necessary to inject into the relationship between the worker and what he is working on a whole series of obligations and constraints that overlay the law of wages, which is apparently the simple law of the market.§ The wage contract must be accompanied by a coercion that is like its validity clause: the working class must be “regenerated,” “moralized.” Thus the transfer of the penitentiary takes place with one social class applying it to another: it is in this class relationship between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat that the condensed and remodeled penitentiary system begins to function; it will be a political instrument of the control and maintenance of relations of production. Fourth, something more is needed for this supplementary code to function effectively and for the delinquent actually to appear as a social enemy: the actual separation of delinquents from non-delinquents within those lower strata practicing illegalism. The great continuous mass of economico-political illegalism, going from common law crime to political revolt, must be broken up and the purely delinquent must be placed on one side, and those free of delinquency, who may be called non-delinquent, on the other. Thus, the bourgeoisie has no great wish to suppress delinquency.18 The main objective of the penal system is breaking this continuum of lower-class illegalism and the organization of a world of delinquency. There are two instruments for this. On the one hand, an ideological instrument: the theory of the delinquent as social enemy. This is no longer someone who struggles against the law, who wishes to evade power, but someone who is at war with every member of society.

Perhaps one should look for what is hidden beneath the apparent cynicism of the penal institution, which, after purging the convicts by means of their sentence, continues to follow them by a whole series of ‘brandings’ (a surveillance that was once de jure and which is today de facto; the police record that has taken the place of the convict’s passport) and which thus pursues as a ‘delinquent’ someone who has acquitted himself of his punishment as an offender? Can we not see here a consequence rather than a contradiction? If so, one would be forced to suppose that the prison, and no doubt punishment in general, is not intended to eliminate offences, but rather to distinguish them, to distribute them, to use them; that it is not so much that they render docile those who are liable to transgress the law, but that they tend to assimilate the transgression of the laws in a general tactics of subjection. Penality would then appear to be a way of handling illegalities, of laying down the limits of tolerance, of giving free rein to some, of putting pressure on others, of excluding a particular section, of making another useful, of neutralizing certain individuals and of profiting from others. In short, penality does not simply ‘check’ illegalities; it ‘differentiates’ them, it provides them with a general ‘economy’. And, if one can speak of justice, it is not only because the law itself or the way of applying it serves the interests of a class, it is also because the differential administration of illegalities through the mediation of penality forms part of those mechanisms of domination. Legal punishments are to be resituated in an overall strategy of illegalities.

It was also organized as a multiple, automatic, and anonymous power; for although surveillance rests on individuals, its functioning is that of a network of relations from top to bottom, but also to a certain extent from bottom to top and laterally; this network ‘holds’ the whole together and traverses it in its entirety with effects of power that derive from one another: supervisors perpetually supervised."},{"id":523,"quote":"El exceso y la pasividad son, para un hombre, las dos formas mayores de la inmoralidad en la práctica de las aphrodisia."},{"id":524,"quote":"During the years 1945-1965, there was a certain way of thinking correctly, a certain style of political discourse, a certain ethics of the intellectual.

They also acted as factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting their influence on the respective forces of both these movements, guaranteeing relations of domination and effects of hegemony. The adjustment of the accumulation of men to that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to the expansion of productive forces and the differential allocation of profit, were made possible in part by the exercise of bio-power in its many forms and modes of application.
