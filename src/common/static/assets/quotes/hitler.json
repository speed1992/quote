They have not the faculty of distinguishing between what isuseful and useless in a book; so that they may retain the former in their minds and ifpossible skip over the latter while reading it, if that be not possible, then--when onceread--throw it overboard as useless ballast. Reading is not an end in itself, but a meansto an end. Its chief purpose is to help towards filling in the framework which is madeup of the talents and capabilities that each individual possesses. Thus each one procuresfor himself the implements and materials necessary for the fulfilment of his calling inlife, no matter whether this be the elementary task of earning one's daily bread or acalling that responds to higher human aspirations. Such is the first purpose of reading.And the second purpose is to give a general knowledge of the world in which we live.In both cases, however, the material which one has acquired through reading must notbe stored up in the memory on a plan that corresponds to the successive chapters of thebook; but each little piece of knowledge thus gained must be treated as if it were a littlestone to be inserted into a mosaic, so that it finds its proper place among all the otherpieces and particles that help to form a general world-picture in the brain of the reader.Otherwise only a confused jumble of chaotic notions will result from all this reading.That jumble is not merely useless, but it also tends to make the unfortunate possessor ofit conceited. For he seriously considers himself a well-educated person and thinks thathe understands something of life. He believes that he has acquired knowledge, whereasthe truth is that every increase in such 'knowledge' draws him more and more awayfrom real life, until he finally ends up in some sanatorium or takes to politics andbecomes a parliamentary deputy.Such a person never succeeds in turning his knowledge to practical account when theopportune moment arrives; for his mental equipment is not ordered with a view tomeeting the demands of everyday life. His knowledge is stored in his brain as a literaltranscript of the books he has read and the order of succession in which he has readthem. And if Fate should one day call upon him to use some of his book-knowledge forcertain practical ends in life that very call will have to name the book and give thenumber of the page; for the poor noodle himself would never be able to find the spotwhere he gathered the information now called for. But if the page is not mentioned atthe critical moment the widely-read intellectual will find himself in a state of hopelessembarrassment.

Como todo gobierno, por malo que sea y aún cuando haya traicionado una y mil veces los intereses de una nacionalidad, reclama para sí el deber que tiene de mantener la autoridad del Estado, el instinto de conservación nacional en lucha contra un gobierno semejante tendrá que servirse, para lograr su libertad o su independencia, de las mismas armas que aquél emplea para mantenerse en al mando.

Amongst the people, moral health is obligatory. It goes so far that in the country one never reproaches a priest for having a liaison with his servant. People even regard it as a kind of guarantee : the women and girls of the village need not protect themselves. In any case, women of the people are full of understanding; they admit that a young priest can't sweat his sperm out through his brain.The hypocrites are to be found amongst the ten-thousandstrong élite. That's where one meets the Puritan who can reproach his neighbour for his adventures, forgetting that he has himself married a divorcée. Everybody should draw from his own experience the reasons to show himself indulgent towards others. Marriage, as it is practised in bourgeoise society, is generally a thing against nature. But a meeting between two beings who complete one another, who are made for one another, borders already, in my conception, upon a miracle.I often think of those women who people the convents—because they haven't met the man with whom they would have wished to share their lives.

And I went after all other problems in the same way. We solved our economic questions, gentlemen, when all the so-called experts claimed they couldn’t be solved. We solved our cultural problems. What didn’t they say earlier! They said, “What? You want to eliminate the Jews? Ha ha! Then you won’t have any more money, you won’t have any more gold”. As if the Jews were a gold-producing element! Gold only has any meaning when it represents value. Values are not created by Jews, but rather, by people who have invented valuable things, or produced them. The Jew simply inserts himself between the inventor or producer and the consumer. He is a valve that restricts the flow. I built a valve which can cut off the flow when needed or let it flow again, at will. When I was young I often went to the German Museum in Munich. That was the first great technical museum at that time. I had a tremendous interest in it – almost the entire inventiveness of the human race is represented there. What was ever invented by Jews? The Jews, who rule everything, the whole economic system, our industrial life, they rule everything! – What did they ever invent? Where are the Jewish inventors? There’s not a single one there! Not one! You can raise the same question in cultural life. People have said to me, “So when you kick out the Jews, you can say goodbye to the theatre! But who really founded our culture? Was it the Jews? Who were our Jewish composers? Who were our great poets? Were our great thinkers [illegible] Jews, perhaps? How do the Jews suddenly succeed in inserting themselves into the production of the same goods that were created by the greatest Germans, or the discoveries that originated with the greatest Germans?

German literature, the German press, is being read as never before, better than ever before. Much better!

If somebody characterizes the morale of a regiment as bad, then the regiment’s commander is responsible for this. A leader is always responsible for his followers. He passes his own spirit on to his followers. If he shows signs of weakness, then his followers will also become weak. If he shows signs of resistance and valor, then his followers will resist and will be valiant. If he shows signs of heroism, then his followers will die heroically. If he shows signs of cowardly capitulation, then his followers will capitulate. The leader of any organization is not only the bearer of its shield. He also fashions its character, its valor. And, in turn, in this sense, he is also responsible for its defeatism. You must hence pass on the faith and insights which you possess to your followers. They must believe in you. And you must always and at all times be the banner, the living banner, behind which they march, an example in all things to the soldier.

Just as we think with shame of the years 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921, and so on, so posterity will think with pride and joy of the age we are fashioning at present. Then, we will have done our duty. A man cannot expect more from life. Everyone will die sooner or later. Thus, there is only one question: how did he live his life? Did he live decently? Did he live courageously? Did he live faithfully and did he fulfill his duties? Or did he live like a drone among his Volk? Did he live as one of those who go with the flow of lethargy or apathy? That is the question.And if there is one reason for living, then it is to be able to say in one’s old age: “For my part, I did my duty. I always was indifferent to what the others did. When one day you look back to this age, I wish that you will be able to do one thing: to look back with a feeling of pride: “Back then, when the Greater German Reich was fighting for its destiny, I was a soldier.

One couldn't imagine a better activity on nature's part than that which consists in deciding the supremacy of one creature over another by means of a constant struggle. While we're on the subject, it's somewhat interesting to observe that our upper classes, who've never bothered about the hundreds of thousands of German emigrants or their poverty, give way to a feeling of compassion regarding the fate of the Jews whom we claim the right to expel. Our compatriots forget too easily that the Jews have accomplices all over the world, and that no beings have greater powers of resistance as regards adaptation to climate. Jews can prosper anywhere, even in Lapland and Siberia. All that love and sympathy, since our ruling class is capable of such sentiments, would by rights be applied exclusively—if that class were not corrupt—to the members of our national community. Here Christianity sets the example. What could be more fanatical, more exclusive and more intolerant than this religion which bases everything on the love of the one and only God whom it reveals? The affection that the German ruling class should devote to the good fellow-citizen who faithfully and courageously does his duty to the benefit of the community, why is it not just as fanatical, just as exclusive and just as intolerant?My attachment and sympathy belong in the first place to the front-line German soldier, who has had to overcome the rigours of the past winter. If there is a question of choosing men to rule us, it must not be forgotten that war is also a manifestation of life, that it is even life's most potent and most characteristic expression. Consequently, I consider that the only men suited to become rulers are those who have valiantly proved themselves in a war. In my eyes, firmness of character is more precious than any other quality. A well toughened character can be the characteristic of a man who, in other respects, is quite ignorant. In my view, the men who should be set at the head of an army are the toughest, bravest, boldest, and, above all, the most stubborn and hardest to wear down. The same men are also the best chosen for posts at the head of the State—otherwise the pen ends by rotting away what the sword has conquered. I shall go so far as to say that, in his own sphere, the statesman must be even more courageous than the soldier who leaps from his trench to face the enemy. There are cases, in fact, in which the courageous decision of a single statesman can save the lives of a great number of soldiers. That's why pessimism is a plague amongst statesmen. One should be able to weed out all the pessimists, so that at the decisive moment these men's knowledge may not inhibit their capacity for action.This last winter was a case in point. It supplied a test for the type of man who has extensive knowledge, for all the bookworms who become preoccupied by a situation's analogies, and are sensitive to the generally disastrous epilogue of the examples they invoke. Agreed, those who were capable of resisting the trend needed a hefty dose of optimism. One conclusion is inescapable: in times of crisis, the bookworms are too easily inclined to switch from the positive to the negative. They're waverers who find in public opinion additional encouragement for their wavering. By contrast, the courageous and energetic optimist—even although he has no wide knowledge— will always end, guided by his subconscious or by mere commonsense, in finding a way out."},{"id":880,"quote":"To teach a nation the handling of arms is to give it a virile education. If the Romans had not recruited Germans in their armies, the latter would never have had the opportunity of becoming soldiers and, eventually, of annihilating their former instructors.

The Romans instructed the Third in the arts of war, and Arminius afterwards used it to defeat his instructors. At the time of the revolt against Rome, the most daring of Arminius' brothers-in-arms were all Germanics who had served some time or other in the Roman legions."},{"id":881,"quote":"En el momento en que los pueblos de este planeta luchan por su existencia, esto es, cuando se les hace inminente el problema decisivo de ser o no ser, quedan reducidas a la nada las consideraciones humanitarias o estéticas.

Incluso entre los hombres ellas son propias sólo de algunos pueblos o, mejor, de ciertas razas, en la medida que éstas provienen del sentimiento de esos mismos pueblos o razas. El sentimiento humanitario y estético desaparecería, hasta incluso de un mundo habitado, una vez que desaparecieran las razas creadoras y portadoras de esas ideas. Todas esas ideas tienen un significado secundario en la lucha de un pueblo por su propia existencia; llegan incluso a desaparecer, una vez que puedan contrariar su instinto de conservación. Por lo que al humanitarismo respecta, ya Moltke dijo que en la guerra lo humanitario radicaba en la celeridad del procedimiento; es decir, que estaba en relación directa con el empleo de los medios de lucha más eficaces. A aquellos que procuran argumentar en esos temas con palabras tales como estética y otras, se les puede responder de la siguiente manera: las cuestiones vitales de la importancia de la lucha por la vida de un pueblo anulan todas las consideraciones de orden estético.

Pues ésta una de las principales razones por las que esa especie de actividad política es despreciable y odiosa a todo hombre de sentimientos decentes y, por tanto, también de valor, al tiempo que atrae a todos los caracteres miserables - aquellos que no quieren asumir la responsabilidad de sus acciones, sino que antes procuran huir, no pasando de cobardes villanos. Las consecuencias se dejarán sentir tan pronto como tales mediocres formen el gobierno de una Nación. Faltará entereza para obrar y se preferirá aceptar las más vergonzosas humillaciones antes de erguirse para adoptar una actitud resuelta, pues nadie habrá allí que por sí solo esté personalmente dispuesto a arriesgarlo todo en pro de la ejecución de una medida radical. Existe una verdad que no debe ni puede olvidarse: es la de que tampoco en este caso una mayoría estará capacitada para sustituir a la personalidad en el gobierno. La mayoría no sólo representa siempre la estupidez, sino también la cobardía. Y del mismo modo que de cien cabezas huecas no se hace un sabio, de cien cabezas no surge nunca una decisión heroica. Cuanto menos grave sea la responsabilidad que pese sobre el Jefe, mayor será el número de aquellos que, dotados de ínfima capacidad, se crean igualmente llamados a poner al servicio de la Nación sus \"imponderables fuerzas\". Con impaciencia esperan que les llegue el turno; forman una larga fila y cuentan, con doloridos lamentos, el número de los que esperan delante de ellos y casi calculan la hora sobre cuándo, posiblemente, alcanzarán su deseo. De ahí que sea para ellos motivo de regocijo el cambio frecuente de funcionarios en los cargos que ellos apetecen y que celebren todo escándalo que reduzca la fila de los que por delante esperan. En el caso de que uno de ellos no quiera dejar la posición alcanzada, casi se considera eso como una quiebra de una combinación sagrada de solidaridad común. Entonces es cuando ellos se vuelven intrigantes y no descansan hasta que el desvergonzado, al final vencido, pone su lugar nuevamente a disposición de todos. Por eso mismo, no alcanzará él tan pronto esa posición. Cuando una de estas criaturas es forzada a desistir de su puesto, procurará inmediatamente entrometerse de nuevo en la hilera de los que están a la expectativa, a no ser que lo impidan, entonces, los gritos y las injurias de los demás. La consecuencia de todo esto es la espeluznante rapidez con que se producen modificaciones en las más importantes jefaturas y oficinas públicas de un organismo estatal semejante, con un resultado que siempre tiene influencia negativa y que muchas veces llega a ser hasta catastrófico, porque no sólo el estúpido y el incapaz son lesionados por esos métodos de proceder, sino incluso los verdaderos jefes, si algún día el Destino los sitúa en esas posiciones de mando. Después que se verifica la aparición de un hombre excepcional, inmediatamente se forma un frente cerrado de defensa, sobre todo si una cabeza tal, no saliendo de las propias filas, osara penetrar en esa sublime sociedad. Lo que ellos quieren fundamentalmente es permanecer entre sí, y es considerado enemigo común todo aquél que pueda sobresalir en medio de tales nulidades. En este sentido, el instinto es tanto más agudo cuanto es inoperante en otros aspectos. El resultado será siempre un creciente empobrecimiento espiritual de las clases dirigentes.

But not in Germany! For here in Germany we had more than enough time-fifteen years-to acquaint ourselves with these democratic ideals. And we ourselves had to pick up the legacy left behind by this democracy.Now we are being credited with many a truly astounding war aim, especially by the English. After all, England is quite experienced in issuing proclamations of objectives in warfare as it has waged the greatest number of wars the world over.Truly astounding are the war aims announced to us today. A new Europe will arise. This Europe will be characterized by justice. This justice will render armament obsolete. This will lead to disarmament at last. This disarmament in turn will bring about an economic blossoming. Change and trade will spring up-much trade-free trade. And with the sponsorship of this trade, culture shall once more blossom, and not only culture will benefit, but religion will also prosper.In other words: we are heading towards a golden age! Well, we have heard of this golden age before. Many times precisely the same people attempted to illustrate its virtues to us who are now flooding us with descriptions of its benefits. The records are old ones, played once too often. We can only pity these gentlemen who cannot even come up with a new idea to trap a great people. For all this they had already promised us in 1918.Then, too, England’s objectives in the war were the creation of this “new Europe, the establishment of a “new justice,” of which the “right to selfdetermination of the peoples” was to form an integral part. Back then already they promised us justice to render obsolete-for all time-the bearing of any sort of weaponry.Back then already they submitted to us a program for disarmament-one for global disarmament. To make this disarmament more evident, it was to be crowned by the establishment of an association of nations bearing no arms.These were to settle their differences in the future-for even back then there was no doubt that differences would still arise-by talking them to death in discussion and debate, just as is the custom in democratic states. There would be no more shooting under any circumstances! In 1918, they declared a blessed and pious age to come! What came to pass in its stead we all lived to see: the old states were destroyed without even as much as asking their citizenry. Historic, ancient structures were severed, not only state bodies but grown economic structures as well, without anything better to take their place. In total disregard of the principle of the right to self-determination of the peoples, the European peoples were hacked to pieces, torn apart. Great states were dissolved.Nations were robbed of their rights, first rendered utterly defenseless and then subjected to a division which left only victors and vanquished in this world.And then there was no more talk of disarmament. To the contrary, armament went on. Nor did any efforts materialize to settle conflicts peacefully. The armed states waged wars just as before. Yet those who had been disarmed were no longer in a position to ward off the aggressions of those well armed.Naturally, this did not herald economic prosperity but, to the contrary, produced a network of lunatic reparations payments which led to increasing destitution for not only the vanquished, but also the so-called victors themselves. The consequences of this economic destitution were felt most acutely by the German Volk.International finance remained brutal and squeezed our Volk ruthlessly.Adolf Hitler – speech in the Sportpalast Berlin, January 30, 1940”"},{"id":922,"quote":"in the swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work."},{"id":923,"quote":"If at this moment we were to eliminate the religions by force, the people would unanimously beseech us for a new form of worship.

When a man occupies such a position, he should eliminate all his family feeling. Napoleon, on the contrary, placed his brothers and sisters in posts of command, and retained them in these posts even after they'd given proofs of their incapability. All that was necessary was to throw out all these patently incompetent relatives. Instead of that, he wore himself out with sending his brothers and sisters, regularly every month, letters containing reprimands and warnings, urging them to do this and not to do that, thinking he could remedy their incompetence by promising them money, or by threatening not to give them any more. Such illogical behaviour can be explained only by the feeling Corsicans have for their families, a feeling in which they resemble the Scots. By thus giving expression to his family feeling, Napoleon introduced a disruptive principle into his life. Nepotism, in fact, is the most formidable protection imaginable : the protection of the ego. But wherever it has appeared in the life of a State—the monarchies are the best proof—it has resulted in weakening and decay. Reason : it puts an end to the principle of effort.In this respect, Frederick the Great showed himself superior to Napoleon—Frederick who, at the most difficult moments of his life, and when he had to take the hardest decisions, never forgot that things are called upon to endure. In similar cases, Napoleon capitulated. It's therefore obvious that, to bring his life's work to a successful conclusion, Frederick the Great could always rely on sturdier collaborators than Napoleon could. When Napoleon set the interests of his family clique above all, Frederick the Great looked around him for men, and, at need, trained them himself.Despite all Napoleon's genius, Frederick the Great was the most outstanding man of the eighteenth century. When seeking to find a solution for essential problems concerning the conduct of affairs of State, he refrained from all illogicality. It must be recognised that in this field his father, Frederick-William, that buffalo of a man, had given him a solid and complete training. Peter the Great, too, clearly saw the necessity for eliminating the family spirit from public life. In a letter to his son—a letter I was re-reading recently—he informs him very clearly of his intention to disinherit him and exclude him from the succession to the throne. It would be too lamentable, he writes, to set one day at the head of Russia a son who does not prepare himself for State affairs with the utmost energy, who does not harden his will and strengthen himself physically.Setting the best man at the head of the State—that's the most difficult problem in the world to solve."},{"id":929,"quote":"En oposición a ese parlamentarismo democrático está la genuina democracia germánica de la libre elección del Führer, que se obliga a asumir toda la responsabilidad de sus actos.

The Jew is the incarnation of egoism. And their egoism goes so far that they're not even capable of risking their lives for the defence of their most vital interests.The Jew totally lacks any interest in things of the spirit. If he has pretended in Germany to have a bent for literature and the arts, that's only out of snobbery, or from a liking for speculation. He has no feeling for art, and no sensibility. Except in the regions where they live in groups, the Jews are said to have reached a very high cultural level! Take Nuremberg, for example: for four hundred years—that is to say, until 1838—it hadn't a single Jew in its population. Result: a situation in the first rank of German cultural life. Put the Jews all together: by the end of three hundred years, they'll have devoured one another. Where we have a philosopher, they have a Talmudistic pettifogger. What for us is an attempt to get to the bottom of things and express the inexpressible, becomes for the Jew a pretext for verbal juggleries. His only talent is for masticating ideas so as to disguise his thought. He has observed that the Aryan is stupid to the point of accepting anything in matters of religion, as soon as the idea of God is recognised. With the Aryan, the belief in the Beyond often takes a quite childish form ; but this belief does represent an effort towards a deepening of things. The man who doesn't believe in the Beyond has no understanding of religion. The great trick of Jewry was to insinuate itself fraudulently amongst the religions with a religion like Judaism, which in reality is not a religion. Simply, the Jew has put a religious camouflage over his racial doctrine. Everything he undertakes is built on this lie.The Jew can take the credit for having corrupted the Graeco- Roman world. Previously words were used to express thoughts; he used words to invent the art of disguising thoughts. Lies are his strength, his weapon in the struggle. The Jew is said to be gifted. His only gift is that of juggling with other people's property and swindling each and everyone. Suppose I find by chance a picture that I believe to be a Titian. I tell the owner what I think of it, and I offer him a price. In a similar case, the Jew begins by declaring that the picture is valueless, he buys it for a song and sells it at a profit of 5000 per cent. To persuade people that a thing which has value, has none, and vice versa—that's not a sign of intelligence. They can't even overcome the smallest economic crisis!The Jew has a talent for bringing confusion into the simplest matters, for getting everything muddled up. Thus comes the moment when nobody understands anything more about the question at issue. To tell you something utterly insignificant, the Jew drowns you in a flood of words. You try to analyse what he said, and you realise it's all wind. The Jew makes use of words to stultify his neighbours. And that's why people make them professors.The law of life is : \"God helps him who helps himself!\" It's so simple that everybody is convinced of it, and nobody would pay to learn it. But the Jew succeeds in getting himself rewarded for his meaningless glibness. Stop following what he says, for a moment, and at once his whole scaffolding collapses. I've always said, the Jews are the most diabolic creatures in existence, and at the same time the stupidest. They can't produce a musician, or a thinker. No art, nothing, less than nothing. They're liars, forgers, crooks. They owe their success only to the stupidity of their victims.If the Jew weren't kept presentable by the Aryan, he'd be so dirty he couldn't open his eyes.

An unknown man who undertook to rid a world of resistance, to tear down walls of prejudice. Prejudice at times is worse than divine force.A man took a stand against all the bearers of public life back then, against the parties, against their press, against the whole system of capitalist fabrication of public opinion. I led this struggle until the final seizure of power.You must understand one thing: that at this moment I could have only one wish, namely, that if this war is indeed inevitable, that it still be fought during my lifetime, because I am the man who possesses the greatest authority with the German Volk. And moreover, because I believe that based on the experiences of my life, I am the most able to strengthen the nation in this battle and to lead it into this battle. Thus, once I became aware that England was determined to fight this battle, I did not capitulate, but in an instant determined to do everything to prepare Germany to hold its own in this most difficult struggle for its existence. And my appeal to the German nation was not in vain. I labored in these years to build up armament for the German Volk. I subordinated everything to the one thought: how can Germany be made strong? How can its armament be made powerful? I was determined to do nothing by half-measures, but to stake everything on one throw. I knew that this struggle would determine whether Germany will be or will not be.It is not a question of a system. It is a question of whether these 85 million people, in their national unity, can carry through on their right to life or not.If yes, then the future of Europe belongs to this Volk. If no, then this Volk shall perish, shall sink back, and it will no longer be worthwhile to live in this Volk.Faced with this alternative, I was determined to employ all means-down to the last-in this struggle. The nation understood this. Millions of men never spoke of it. Still all thought the same. And throughout this period, nobody ever reproached me for this enormous mobilization of public means for the one goal: national armament. I also wished that, if the hour was to come and come it would, the German soldier should not set out against the enemy as, regrettably, this has been the case far too often in Germany’s past.This phrase, “the best weapons for the best soldier in the world, has profound meaning. The best soldier must and will despair once it dawns on him that, in spite of his valor, the effectiveness of his arms does not suffice to force the victory. Therefore, I was determined to do my utmost to secure for us the best arms. And, before German history, I may be faulted on many a thing, but on one topic assuredly not: that I had not done my utmost, what was humanly possible, to prepare the German Volk better for this struggle than, regrettably, it was prepared in the year 1914. In this, I found the support of countless people, men of the state, the Party, and in particular the Wehrmacht. They walked by my side. And thus we were able, in barely seven years, to make the German Wehrmacht once more the world’s best. And, for my person, I have always been convinced that for us Germans there are only two possibilities: either we are no soldiers or we are the world’s best. There is no in-between.Adolf Hitler - speech at the annual rally of young officer cadets at the Berlin Sportpalast December 18, 1940”"},{"id":951,"quote":"Great speech to the German ReichstagBerlin, January 30, 1939Once again I will be a prophet: should the international Jewry of finance (Finanzjudentum) succeed, both within and beyond Europe, in plunging mankind into yet another world war, then the result will not be a Bolshevization of the earth and the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation (Vernichtung) of the Jewish race in Europe. Thus, the days of propagandist impotence of the non-Jewish peoples are over.National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy possess institutions which, if necessary, permit opening the eyes of the world to the true nature of this problem.Many a people is instinctively aware of this, albeit not scientifically versed in it.At this moment, the Jews are still propagating their campaign of hatred in certain states under the cover of press, film, radio, theater, and literature, which are all in their hands. Should indeed this one Volk attain its goal of prodding masses of millions from other peoples to enter into a war devoid of all sense for them, and serving the interests of the Jews exclusively, then the effectiveness of an enlightenment will once more display its might. Within Germany, this enlightenment conquered Jewry utterly in the span of a few years.Peoples desire not to perish on the battlefield just so that this rootless, internationalist race can profit financially from this war and thereby gratify its lust for vengeance derived from the Old Testament.

We have already done this in Germany a long time ago. Or when he says that the sick ought to be taken care of. Please leave the garden of our party program-this is National Socialist teaching and not yours, Sir! This is heresy for a democrat.Or when he says, “we want laborers to have a vacation.” It is a little late to want this, since we have already put this into practice. And we would be much further along now if Mr. Roosevelt had not interfered. Or when he says, “we want to increase prosperity for the masses of laborers, too.” All these things are in our program! He might have seen them through, if he had not started the war. After all, we did all this before the war. No, these capitalist hyenas do not have the slightest intention of doing this. They see us as a suspicious example.And now, in order to lure their own people, they have to get in on our party program and fish out a few sentences, these poor bunglers. And even that they do imperfectly.We had a world unanimously against us here. Of course, not only on the right, but also on the left. Those on the left feared: “What are we going to do, if this experiment succeeds and he actually makes it and eliminates the housing problem? What if he manages to introduce an educational system based on which a talented boy, no matter who his parents are, can attain God knows what position? And, he is capable of doing it, he is already making a Reich protector out of a former farmhand. What if he really introduces an old-age pension scheme covering the whole Volk? What if he truly secures a right to vacations for the whole Volk, since he is already building ships? And he is bringing all this up to an ordered and secured standard of living. What are we going to do? We live by the absence of this. We live by this and, therefore, we must fight National Socialism.” What the others have accomplished-that, our comrades were best able to see in Russia. We have been in power for nine years now. Bolshevism has been there since 1917, that is, almost twenty-five years. Everyone can judge for himself by comparing this Russia with Germany. The things we did in these nine years. What does the German Volk look like, and what have they accomplished over there? I do not even want to mention the capitalist states.They do not take care of their unemployed, because no American millionaire will ever come into the area where they live, and no unemployed man will ever go to the area where the millionaires live. While hunger marches to Washington and to the White House are organized, they are usually dispersed en route by the police by means of rubber truncheons and tear gas.

We National Socialists have become great in this knowledge. By devoting our attention to the existence of the race problem, we have found the solution for many problems which would have otherwise have seemed incomprehensible.The hidden forces which incited England already in 1914, in the first world war, were Jews. The force which paralyzed us at that time and finally forced us to surrender with the slogan that Germany was no longer able to bear homeward a victorious flag, came from the Jews. It was the Jews who fomented the revolution among our people and thus robbed us of every possibility at further resistance. Since 1939 the Jews have maneuvered the British Empire into the most perilous crisis it has ever known. The Jews were the carriers of that Bolshevist infection which once threatened to destroy Europe. It was also they who incited the ranks of the plutocracies to war, and it is the Jews who have driven America to war against all her own interests, simply and solely from the Jewish capitalistic point of view. And President Roosevelt, lacking ability himself, lends an ear to his brain trust, whose leading men I do not need to mention by name; they are Jews, nothing but Jews. And once again, as in the year 1915, she (America) will be incited by a Jewish President and his completely Jewish entourage to go to war without any reason or sense whatever, with nations which have never done anything to America, and with people from whom America can never win anything. For what is the sense of a war waged by a state having territory without people against people without territory. In the terms of the war it is no longer a question of the interests of individual nations; it is, rather, a question of conflict between nations which want to make the lives of their people secure on this earth, and nations which have become the helpless tools of an international world parasite.The German soldiers and the allies have had an opportunity to witness at first hand the actual work of this Jewish International-war mongers in that country in which Jewish dictatorship has exclusive power and in which it is being taught as the most ideal form of government in the world for future generations and to which low subjects of other nations have become inexplicably subservient just as this was the case with us at one time.And at this juncture this seemingly senile Europe has, as always in the course of its history, raised aloft the torch of its perception and today the men of Europe are marching as the representatives of a new and better order as the genuine youth of social and national liberty throughout the world.Gentlemen! In the course of this winter a decision has been reached in international struggle which as regards to problems involved far exceeds in scope those difficulties which must and can be solved in normal warfare; when in November 1918 the German nation being befogged by the hypocritical phraseology of the American President at that time, Wilson, laid down its arms, although undefeated, and withdrew from the field of battle it was acting under the influence of that Jewish race which hoped to succeed in establishing a secure bulwark of Bolshevism in the very heart of Europe.We know the theoretical principles and the cruel truth regarding the aims of this world-wide pestilence. It is called, \"the Rule of the Proletariat,\" and it really is \"Jewish Dictatorship,\" the extermination of national government and of the intelligent element among the nations, and the rule over the proletariat after it has thus deprived of its leaders and through its own fault ended defenseless by the concerted efforts of Jewish international criminals."},{"id":955,"quote":"It was only natural that the hardships of his youth should enhance his subsequent achievement in his eyes, particularly since it resulted exclusively from his own energy and iron diligence.

After all, Germany was itself so ill at the time, so weakened by the spreading Jewish infection, that it could hardly think of overcoming the Bolshevik danger at home, not to mention abroad. The economic ruin brought about by the Jews as in other countries, the unemployment of millions of Germans, the destruction of peasantry, trade, and industry only prepared the way for the planned internal collapse. This was furthered by support for the continued existence of a senseless state of classes, which could only serve to transform the reason of the masses into hatred in order to make them the willing instrument of the Bolshevik revolution. By mobilizing the proletarian slaves, the Jews hoped that, following the destruction of the national intelligentsia, they could all the more reduce them for good to coolies. But even if this process of the Bolshevik revolt in the interior of Germany had not led to complete success, the state with its democratic Weimar constitution would have been reduced to something ridiculously helpless in view of the great tasks of current world politics. In order to be armed for this confrontation, not only the problems of political power but also the social and economic problems had to be resolved.When National Socialism undertook the realization of its program eleven years ago, it managed just in time to build up a state that did not only have the strength at home but also the power abroad to fulfill the same European mission which first Greece fulfilled in antiquity by opposing the Persians, then Rome [by opposing] the Carthaginians, and the Occident in later centuries by opposing the invasions from the east.Therefore, in the year 1933, we set ourselves four great tasks among many others. On their resolution depended not only the future of the Reich but also the rescue of Europe, perhaps even of the entire human civilization:1. The Reich had to regain the internal social peace that it had lost by resolving the social questions. That meant that the elements of a division into classes bourgeoisie and proletariat-had to be eliminated in their various manifestations and be replaced by a Volksgemeinschaft. The appeal to reason had to be supplemented by the merciless eradication of the base elements of resistance in all camps.2. The social and political unification of the nation had to be supplemented by a national, political one. This meant that the body of the Reich, which was not only politically, but also governmentally divided, had to be replaced by a unified National Socialist state, the construction and leadership of which were suited to oppose and withstand even the heaviest attacks and severest tests of the future.3. The nationally and politically coherent centralized state had the mission of immediately creating a Wehrmacht, whose ideology, moral attitude, numerical strength, and material equipment could serve as an instrument of self-assertion. After the outside world had rejected all German offers for a limitation of armament, the Reich had to fashion its own armament accordingly.4. In order to secure its continued existence in Europe with the prospect of actual success, it was necessary to integrate all those countries which were inhabited by Germans, or were areas which had belonged to the German Reich for over a thousand years and which, in terms of their national substance and economy, were indispensable to the preservation of the Reich, that is, for its political and military defense.Only the resolution of all these tasks could result in the creation of that state which was capable, at home and abroad, of waging the fight for its defense and for the preservation of the European family of nations."},{"id":959,"quote":"In four years of struggle, this Volk faced off twenty-six states and was only vanquished by betrayal and dishonesty!

Men of the German Reichstag! Ever since the rejection of my last peace proposal in July 1940, we have been aware that this war has to be fought to the bitter end. That the Anglo-American, Jewish-capitalist world formed a front with Bolshevism does not come as a surprise to us National Socialists. At home, we found them in the same union, and we succeeded in our struggle at home by defeating our enemies after a sixteen-year-long struggle for power.When I decided twenty-three years ago to enter politics in order to reverse the decline of the nation, I was a nameless, unknown soldier. Many of you know how difficult the first years of this struggle were. The way from a small movement of seven men to the taking over of responsible government on January 30, 1933, was so miraculous that Providence itself must have made it possible through its blessings.Today, I head the strongest army in the world, the mightiest air force, and a proud navy. Behind me, I am conscious of the sworn community of the party, which made me great and which became great through me.The enemies that I confront have been known to be our enemies for over twenty years. Alas, the road that lies ahead of me cannot be compared to the one lying behind me. The German Volk realizes the decisiveness of the hour for its existence. Under the most difficult circumstances, millions of soldiers are obediently and loyally doing their duty.The American President and his plutocratic clique have called us a people of have nots. That is right! And these have-nots want to live. In any event, they will not allow the owners to rob them of the little that they have to live on. My party comrades, you know my relentless resolve to conclude a struggle victoriously once it has begun. You know my intention not to shy away from anything in such a fight and to break all the resistance that has to be broken.In my speech on September 1, 1939, I assured you that, in this struggle, neither the force of arms nor time will defeat Germany. I want to assure my enemies that neither will the force of arms nor time defeat us, but neither inner doubts make us falter in the fulfillment of our duty. When we consider the sacrifices of our soldiers, how they risk their lives, then the sacrifices of the homeland become completely insignificant and unimportant. When we think of the numbers of those who, generations before us, fell for the existence and greatness of the German Volk, then we become all the more aware of the greatness of the duty imposed on us.Whoever seeks to forsake this duty has no right to expect treatment as a Volksgenosse in our midst.Therefore, no one can expect to live who thinks that he can depreciate the front’s sacrifices at home. Irrespective of the form of disguise for this attempt to disrupt this German front, to undermine this Volk’s willingness to resist, to weaken the authority of this regime, to sabotage the efforts of the homeland, the offender will fall! There will be only one difference: the soldier honorably makes this sacrifice at the front, while the other, who wishes to depreciate this honorable sacrifice, dies in shame.Our enemies should not deceive themselves. In the two thousand years of the history known to us, our German Volk has never been more unified and united than it is today. The Lord of the Worlds has done so many great things for us in the last years that we bow in gratitude before Providence, which has permitted us to be members of such a great Volk. We thank Him that, in view of past and future generations of the German Volk, we were also allowed to enter our names honorably in the undying book of German history."},{"id":985,"quote":"First, I became a nationalist."},{"id":986,"quote":"After all, who are they - these egoists!

In spite of this, a concern weighed heavily on me. It was clear to me that, ultimately, behind this war was that incendiary who has always lived off the quarrels of nations: the international Jew. I would no longer have been a National Socialist had I ever distanced myself from this realization.We followed his traces over many years. In this Reich, probably for the first time, we scientifically resolved this problem for all time, according to plan, and really understood the words of a great Jew who said that the racial question was the key to world history. Therefore, we knew quite well-above all, I knew-that the driving force behind these occurrences was the Jew. And that, as always in history, there were blockheads ready to stand up for him: partly spineless, paid characters, partly people who want to make deals and, at no time, flinch from having blood spilled for these deals. I have come to know these Jews as the incendiaries of the world.After all, in the previous years, you saw how they slowly poisoned the people via the press, radio, film, and theater. You saw how this poisoning continued. You saw how their finances, their money transactions, had to work in this sense. And, in the first days of the war, certain Englishmen-all of them shareholders in the armament industry-said it openly: “The war must last three years at least. It will not and must not end before three years.-That is what they said. That was only natural, since their capital was tied up and they could not hope to secure an amortization in less than three years. Certainly, my party comrades, for us National Socialists, this almost defies comprehension.But that is how things are in the democratic world. You can be prime minister or minister of war and, at the same time, own portfolios of countless shares in the armament industry. Interests are explained that way.We once came to know this danger as the driving force in our domestic struggle. We had this black-red-golden coalition in front of us; this mixture of hypocrisy and abuse of religion on the one hand, and financial interests on the other; and, finally, their truly Jewish-Marxist goals. We completely finished off this coalition at home in a hard struggle. Now, we stand facing this enemy abroad. He inspired this international coalition against the German Volk and the German Reich.First, he used Poland as a dummy, and later pressed France, Belgium, Holland, and Norway to serve him. From the start, England was a driving force here. Understandably, the power which would one day confront us is most clearly ruled by this Jewish spirit: the Soviet Union. It happens to be the greatest servant of Jewry.Time meanwhile has proved what we National Socialists maintained for many years: it is truly a state in which the whole national intelligentsia has been slaughtered, and where only spiritless, forcibly proletarianized subhumans remain. Above them, there is the gigantic organization of the Jewish commissars, that is, established slaveowners. Frequently people wondered whether, in the long run, nationalist tendencies would not be victorious there.But they completely forgot that the bearers of a conscious nationalist view no longer existed. That, in the end, the man who temporarily became the ruler of this state, is nothing other than an instrument in the hands of this almighty Jewry.

I regret this war not only because of the sacrifices that it demands of my German Volk and of other people, but also because of the time it takes away from those who intend to carry out a great social and civilizing work and who want to complete it. After all, what Mr. Roosevelt is capable of achieving, he has proved. What Mr. Churchill has achieved, nobody knows. I can only feel profound regret at what this war will prevent me and the entire National Socialist movement from doing for many years. It is a shame that a person cannot do anything about true bunglers and lazy fellows stealing the valuable time that he wanted to dedicate to cultural, social, and economic projects for his Volk.The same applies to Fascist Italy. There, too, one man has perpetuated his name for all time through a civilizing and national revolution of worldwide dimensions. In the same way it cannot be compared to the democratic-political bungling of the idlers and dividend profiteers, who, in the Anglo-American countries, for instance, spend the wealth accumulated by their fathers or acquire new wealth through shady deals.

We will see who will be stronger in this struggle: those who have nothing to lose and everything to win, or those who have everything to lose and who cannot win anything. What does England want to win? What does America want to win? They have so much that they do not know what to do with all they own. They need to feed only a few people per square kilometer. They do not have all those worries that trouble us. For us, a single bad harvest is a national disaster. They have the whole world at their disposal.

It alone leads men to voluntary recognition of the privilege of force and strength, and thus makes them into a dust particle of that order which shapes and forms the whole universe.The purest idealism is unconsciously equivalent to the deepest knowledge."},{"id":1015,"quote":"A revolution has three main objectives.

Secondly, it's a matter of creating a standard of living such that the poorest will be assured of a decent existence. Finally, it's a matter of acting in such a way that the benefits of civilisation become common property.The people who call themselves democrats blame us for our social policy as if it were a kind of disloyalty: according to them, it imperils the privileges of the owning classes. They regard it as an attack on liberty; for liberty, in their view, is the right of those who have power to continue to exercise it. I understand their reaction very well—but we had no choice. National Socialism is a purely German phenomenon, and we never intended to revolutionise the world. It was enough for us to be given a free hand in Russia and to be offered a few colonies. And the English could still be leading their comfortable little existence. It's obvious that, in the long run, they couldn't have avoided certain social reforms. One can't, in fact, bridge the gap that exists between rich and poor merely with the consolations of religion.

After all, the Germany of Weimar with its Centrist-Marxist democratic party politics would have been swept away by this Central Asian invasion as a straw would be by a hurricane.We realize with increasing clarity that the confrontation that has taken place in Europe since the First World War is slowly beginning to look like a struggle which can only be compared with the greatest historic events of the past. Eternal Jewry forced on us a pitiless and merciless war. Should we not be able to stop the elements of destruction at Europe’s borders, then this continent will be transformed into a single field of ruins.The gravest consequences of this war would then be not only the burned cities and destroyed cultural monuments, but also the bestially murdered multitudes, which would become the victim of this Central Asian flood, just as with the invasions by the Huns and Mongols.What the German and allied soldiers today protect in the east is not the stony face of this continent or its social and intellectual character, but its eternal human substance, whence all values originated ages and ages ago and which gave expression to all human civilizations today, not only to those in Europe and America.In addition to this world of barbarity threatening from the east, we are witnessing the satanic destructive frenzy of its ally, the so-called West. We know about our enemies’ war objectives from countless publications, speeches, and open demands. The babble of the Atlantic Charter is worth as much as Wilson’s Fourteen Points in contrast with the implemented actual design of the Diktat of Versailles.Just as in the English parliamentary democracy the warmonger Churchill pointed the way for later developments with his claim in 1936, when he was not yet the responsible leader of Great Britain, that Germany had to be destroyed again, so the elements behind the present demands for peace in the same democracies today are already planning the state to which they seek to reduce Europe after the war.And their objectives totally correspond with the manifestations of their Bolshevik allies, which we have not only known about but also witnessed: the extermination of all continental people proudly conscious of their nationality and, at their head, the extermination of our own German people.It makes no difference whether English or American papers, parliamentarians, stump orators, or men of letters demand the destruction of the Reich, the abduction of the children of our Volk, the sterilization of our male youth, and so on, as the primary war objective, or whether Bolshevism implements the slaughter of whole groups of people, men, women, and children, in practice.After all, the driving force behind this remains the eternal hatred of that cursed race which, as a true scourge of God, chastised the nations for many thousands of years, until they began to defend themselves against their tormentors in times of reflection.Speech in Lichthof of the Zeughaus for the Heroes’ Memorial Day Berlin, March 21, 1943"},{"id":1029,"quote":"Perché non ero nato cent'anni prima?

The liberal age is a thing of the past. The belief that you can counter this invasion of the people by parliamentary-democratic half-measures is childish and just as naive as Metternich’s methods when the national drives for unification were making their way through the nineteenth century. The lack of a truly social, new form of life results in the lack of the mental will to resist not only in the nations but also in the lack of the moral power of resistance of their leaders. In all countries we see that the attempted renaissance of a democracy has proved fruitless. The confused tangle of political dilettantes and military politicians of a bygone bourgeois world who order each other around is, with deadly certainty, preparing for a plunge into chaos and, insofar as Europe is concerned, into an economic and ethnic catastrophe. And, after all, one thing has already been proved: this most densely populated continent in the world will either have to live with an order that gives the greatest consideration to individual abilities, guarantees the greatest accomplishments, and, by taming all egotistical drives, prevents their excesses, or states such as we have in central and western Europe will prove unfit for life, which means that their nations are thereby doomed to perish! In this manner-following the example of royal Italy-Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary collapsed during this year. This collapse is primarily the result of the cowardice and lack of resolve of their leaders. They and their actions can be understood only in light of the corrupt and socially amoral atmosphere of the bourgeois world. The hatred which many statesmen, especially in these countries, express for the present German Reich is nothing other than the voice of a guilty conscience, an expression of an inferiority complex in view of our organization of a human community that is suspicious to them because we successfully pursue goals that again do not correspond to their own narrow economic egotism and their resulting political shortsightedness.For us, my German Volksgenossen, this, however, represents a new obligation to recognize ever more clearly that the existence or nonexistence of a German future depends on the uncompromising organization of our Volksstaat, that all the sacrifices which our Volk must make are conceivable only under the condition of a social order which clears away all privileges and thereby makes the entire Volk not only bear the same duties but also possess the same vital rights. Above all, it must mercilessly destroy the social phantoms of a bygone era. In their stead, it must place the most valuable reality there is, namely the Volk, the masses which, tied together by the same blood, essence, and experiences of a long history, owe their origin as an individual existence not to an earthly arbitrariness but to the inscrutable will of the Almighty.

Para los intelectuales, o para aquellos que hoy, lamentablemente, así se consideran, no se debe hablar de propaganda y sí de instrucción científica. Semejantes son las condiciones con las que hoy designamos la palabra propaganda. El fin de la propaganda no es la educación científica de cada cual, y sí llamar la atención de la masa sobre determinados hechos, necesidades, etcétera, cuya importancia sólo de esta forma entra en el círculo visual de la masa. El arte está exclusivamente en hacer esto de una manera tan perfecta que provoque la convicción de la realidad de un hecho, de la necesidad de un procedimiento, y de la justicia de algo necesario. La propaganda no es y no puede ser una necesidad en sí misma, ni una finalidad. De la misma manera como en el supuesto del cartel, su misión es la de llamar la atención de la masa y no enseñar a los cultos o a aquellos que procuran cultivar su espíritu; su acción debe estar cada vez más dirigida al sentimiento y sólo muy condicionalmente a la llamada razón. Toda acción de propaganda tiene que ser necesariamente popular y adaptar su nivel intelectual a la capacidad receptiva del más limitado de aquellos a los cuales está destinada. De ahí que su grado netamente intelectual deberá regularse tanto más hacia abajo, y cuanto más grande sea el conjunto de la masa humana que ha de abarcarse. Mas, cuando se trata de atraer hacia el radio de influencia de la propaganda a toda una Nación, como exigen las circunstancias en el caso del sostenimiento de una guerra, nunca se podrá ser lo suficientemente prudente en lo que concierne a cuidar que las formas intelectuales de la propaganda sean simples en lo posible. Cuanto más modesta sea su carga científica y cuanto más tenga en consideración el sentimiento de la masa, tanto mayor será su éxito. Esto, sin embargo, es la mejor prueba de lo acertado o erróneo de una propaganda, y no la satisfacción de las exigencias de algunos sabios o jóvenes estetas. El arte de la propaganda reside justamente en la comprensión de la mentalidad y de los sentimientos de la gran masa. Ella encuentra, por la forma psicológicamente adecuada, el camino para la atención y para el corazón del pueblo. Que nuestros sabios no comprendan esto, la causa reside en su pereza mental o en su orgullo. Comprendiéndose la necesidad de la conquista de la gran masa, por medio de la propaganda, se saca la siguiente conclusión: es errado querer dar a la propaganda la variedad, por ejemplo, de la enseñanza científica. La capacidad receptiva de la gran masa es sumamente limitada y no menos pequeña su facultad de comprensión; en cambio, es enorme su falta de memoria. Teniendo en cuenta estos antecedentes, toda propaganda eficaz debe concretarse sólo a muy pocos puntos y saberlos explotar como apotegmas hasta que el último hijo del pueblo pueda formarse una idea de aquello que se persigue. En el momento en que la propaganda sacrifique ese principio o quiera hacerse múltiple, quedará debilitada su eficacia por la sencilla razón de que la masa no es capaz de retener ni asimilar todo lo que se le ofrece. Y con esto sufre detrimento el resultado, para acabar a la larga por ser completamente nulo. Cuanto más importante sea el objetivo a alcanzar, tanto más cierta, psicológicamente, debe ser la táctica a emplear."},{"id":1075,"quote":"The Soviets could have become a mortal danger to us, if they had succeeded in undermining the military spirit of our soldiers with the slogan of the German Communist Party: \"No more War!\" For at the same time as they were trying by Communist Party terrorism, by strikes, by their press, and by every other means at their disposal to ensure the triumph of pacifism in our country, the Russians were building up an enormous army. Disregarding the namby-pamby utterances about humanitarianism which they spread so assiduously in Germany, in their own country they drove their workers to an astonishing degree, and the Soviet worker was taught by means of the Stakhanov system to work both harder and longer than his counterpart in either Germany or the capitalist States. The more we see of conditions in Russia, the more thankful we must be that we struck in time. In another ten years there would have sprung up in Russia a mass of industrial centres, inaccessible to attack, which would have produced armaments on an inexhaustible scale, while the rest of Europe would have degenerated into a defenceless plaything of Soviet policy.It is very stupid to sneer at the Stakhanov system. The arms and equipment of the Russian armies are the best proof of its efficiency in the handling of industrial man power. Stalin, too, must command our unconditional respect. In his own way he is a hell of a fellow ! He knows his models, Genghiz Khan and the others, very well, and the scope of his industrial planning is exceeded only by our own Four Year Plan.

La Naturaleza misma suele oponerse al aumento de población en determinados países o en ciertas razas, y esto en épocas de hambre o por condiciones climáticas desfavorables, así como tratándose de la escasa fertilidad del suelo. Por cierto que la Naturaleza obra aquí sabiamente y sin contemplaciones; no anula propiamente la capacidad de procreación, pero sí se opone ala conservación de la prole al someter a ésta a rigurosas pruebas y privaciones tan arduas, que todo el que no es fuerte y sano vuelve al seno de lo desconocido. El que entonces sobrevive, a pesar de los rigores de la lucha por la existencia, resulta mil veces experimentado, fuerte y apto para seguir generando, de tal suerte que el proceso de la selección puede empezar de nuevo. Actuando de ese modo brutal contra el individuo y llamándolo de nuevo momentáneamente a desaparecer, por no ser capaz de resistir la tempestad de la vida, la Naturaleza mantiene la Raza, la propia especie vigorosa y la hace capaz de las mayores realizaciones. La disminución del número implica así la vigorización del individuo y con ello, finalmente, la consolidación de la Raza. Otra cosa es que el hombre, por sí mismo, se empeñe en restringir su descendencia. Aquí es preciso considerar no sólo el factor natural, sino también el humano. El hombre cree saber más que esa cruel Reina de toda la sabiduría, la Naturaleza. Él no limita la conservación del individuo, sino la propia reproducción. Eso le parece a él (que siempre se ve a sí mismo y nunca a la Raza) más humano y más justificado que lo otro. Infelizmente, las consecuencias son también inversas. En cuanto a la Naturaleza, liberando la generación, somete, entre tanto, la conservación de la especie a una prueba de las más severas, escogiendo dentro de un gran número de individuos los que juzga mejores, y sólo a éstos preserva para la perpetuación de la especie; el hombre limita la procreación y se esfuerza denodadamente para que cada ser, una vez nacido, se conserve a cualquier precio. Esta corrección de la voluntad divina le parece ser tan sabia como humana, y él se alegra más de una vez por haber sobrepujado a la Naturaleza y hasta haber demostrado la insuficiencia de la misma. Y el hijo de Adán no quiere ver ni oír hablar que, en realidad, el número es limitado, pero a costa del abatimiento del individuo. Siendo limitada la procreación, por disminución del número de nacimientos, sobreviene, en lugar de la natural lucha por la vida (que sólo deja en pie al más fuerte y al más sano), como lógica consecuencia, el prurito de \"salvar\" a todo trance también al débil y hasta al enfermo, cimentando el germen de una progenie que irá degenerando progresivamente, mientras persista ese escarnio de la Naturaleza y sus leyes. El resultado final es que un pueblo tal perderá algún día el derecho a la existencia en este mundo, pues el hombre puede, durante un cierto tiempo, desafiarlas leyes eternas de la conservación, pero la venganza vendrá, más tarde o más temprano. Una generación más fuerte expulsará a los débiles, pues el ansia por la vida, en su última forma, siempre romperá todas las corrientes ridículas del llamado espíritu de humanidad individualista.

Así, cuando el teorizante busca, en lugar de la verdad absoluta, tomar en consideración las llamadas \"oportunidad\" y \"realidad\", dejará éste de ser una estrella polar para transformarse en un recetador cotidiano. El teorizante de un Movimiento ideológico puntualiza la finalidad de éste; el político aspira a realizarla. El primero se subordina en su modo de pensar a la verdad eterna, en tanto que el segundo somete su manera de obrar a la realidad práctica. La grandeza de uno reside en la verdad absoluta y abstracta de su idea, la del otro en el punto de vista cierto en que se coloca con relación a los hechos y al aprovechamiento útil de los mismos, debiendo servir de guía a éste el objetivo del teorizante. En cuanto al éxito de los planes, esto es, la realización de esas acciones, pueden ser consideradas como piedra de toque en la importancia de un político, ya que nunca se podrá realizar la última intención del teorizante sin éste, pues al pensamiento humano le es dado comprender las verdades, adornar ideales claros como el cristal, sin embargo la realización de los mismos es demolida por la imperfección e insuficiencia humanas. Cuanto más abstractamente cierta, y, por tanto, más formidable fuera una idea, tanto más imposible se vuelve su realización, una vez que ésta depende de criaturas humanas.

This idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure in which its application became difficult and finally impossible.So, first of all, the fight, and then pacifism. If it were otherwise, it would mean that mankind has already passed the zenith of its development, and accordingly, the end would not be the supremacy of some moral ideal, but degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos.People may laugh at this statement, but our planet moved through space for millions of years, uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily begin to do so again, if men should forget that wherever they have reached a superior level of existence, it was not as a result of following the ideas of crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron laws of Nature.What reduces one race to starvation stimulates another to harder work.All the great civilisations of the past became decadent because the originally creative race died out, as a result of contamination of the blood.The most profound cause of such a decline is to be found in the fact that the people ignored the principle that all culture depends on men, and not the reverse.In other words, in order to preserve a certain culture, the type of manhood that creates such a culture must be preserved, but such a preservation goes hand in hand with the inexorable law that it is the strongest and the best who must triumph and that they have the right to endure.He who would live must fight. He who does not wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist.Such a saying may sound hard, but, after all, that is how the matter really stands. Yet far harder is the lot of him who believes that he can overcome Nature, and thus in reality insults her. Distress, misery, and disease, are her rejoinders.Whoever ignores or despises the laws of race really deprives himself of the happiness to which he believes he can attain, for he places an obstacle in the victorious path of the superior race and, by so doing, he interferes with a prerequisite condition of, all human progress.Loaded with the burden of human sentiment, he falls back to the level of a helpless animal.It would be futile to attempt to discuss the question as to what race or races were the original champions of human culture and were thereby the real founders of all that we understand by the word ‘humanity.’It is much simpler to deal with this question in so far as it relates to the present time. Here the answer is simple and clear.Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and technical skill, which we see before our eyes to-day, is almost, exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power. All that we admire in the world to-day, its science and its art, its technical developments and discoveries, are the products of the creative activities of a few peoples, and it may be true that their first beginnings must be attributed to one race.The existence of civilisation is wholly dependent on such peoples. Should they perish, all that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them into the grave.He is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed forth, always kindling anew that fire which, in the form of knowledge, illuminated the dark night by drawing aside the veil of mystery and thus showing man how to rise and become master over all the other beings on the earth.Should he be forced to disappear, a profound darkness will descend on the earth; within a few thousand years human culture will vanish and the world will become a desert."},{"id":1092,"quote":"There never was a party more badly led than the Social Democratic Party; and yet the masses flocked to join and support it.

Esto se aplica sobre todo al llamado político de \"éxito\", de pequeño porte, cuya actividad de facto no es nada más que el \"arte de lo posible\", como modestamente Bismarck denominaba a la política. Cuanto más libre se mantiene el político de grandes ideas, tanto más fáciles, comunes, rápidos y también visibles serán sus éxitos. Aunque es verdad también que éstos están destinados al olvido de los hombres y, a veces, no llegan ni a sobrevivir a la muerte de sus creadores. La obra de tales políticos es, de modo general, sin valor alguno para la posteridad, pues su éxito eventual reposa en el alejamiento de todos los problemas e ideas grandiosas que como tales hubieran sido de gran importancia para las generaciones venideras. La realización de ideas destinadas a tener influencia sobre el futuro es poco lucrativa y sí muy raramente comprendida por la gran masa, a la que interesan más las reducciones de precio en la cerveza y en la leche que los grandes planes de futuro, de realización tardía y cuyo beneficio, al final, sólo será usufructuado por la posteridad. Es así como, por una cierta vanidad, la que está siempre asociada a la política, la mayoría de los políticos se apartan de los proyectos realmente difíciles, para no perder la simpatía de la gran masa. El éxito y la importancia de ese político residen exclusivamente en el presente, y son inexistentes para la posteridad. Esos microcéfalos poco se enfadan por eso; ellos se contentan con poco. Diferentes son las condiciones del teorizante. Su importancia casi siempre está en el futuro, por eso no es raro que se le considere lunático. Si el arte del político era considerado el arte de lo posible, se puede decir del idealista que él pertenece a aquellos que sólo agradan a los dioses cuando exigen o quieren lo imposible. Él tendrá casi siempre que renunciar al reconocimiento del presente; adquiere, por ello, en el caso de que sus ideas sean inmortales, la gloria de la posteridad. En períodos raros de la historia de la Humanidad puede acontecer que el político y el idealista se reúnan en la misma persona. Cuanto más íntima fuese esa unión, tanto mayores serán las resistencias opuestas a la acción del político. Él no trabaja ya más para las necesidades al alcance del primer burgués, y sí por los ideales que sólo pocos comprenden. Es por eso que su vida es blanco del amor y del odio. La protesta del presente, que no comprende al hombre, lucha con el reconocimiento de la posteridad por la cual él trabaja. Cuanto mayores fueran las obras de un hombre para el futuro, tanto menos serán éstas comprendidas por el presente; cuanto más dura sea la lucha, tanto más raro el éxito. Si en años nada le sonríe, es posible que en sus últimos días le circunde un tenue halo de gloria venidera. Es cierto que esos grandes hombres son los corredores del maratón de la Historia. La corona de laurel del presente se pone más comúnmente en las sienes del héroe moribundo. Entre éstos se encuentran los grandes luchadores que, incomprendidos por el presente, están decididos a luchar por sus ideas y sus ideales. Son éstos los que, tarde o temprano, tocarán el corazón del pueblo. Hasta parece que cada uno siente el deber de, en el presente, redimir el pecado cometido en el pasado.

De otro modo corre el peligro de tener que cambiar un día de opinión en cuestiones fundamentales o de quedar - en contra de su propia convicción - estratificado en un criterio ya relegado por la razón y el entendimiento.

In a hundred years' time, the number of people wearing spectacles, and the size of the human brain, will both have increased considerably; but the people will be none the more intelligent.

In spite of this, I grew up into a reasonably intelligent young man, I developed along very normal lines, and I learnt a lot of things of which my schoolfellows learnt nothing. In short, our system of education is the exact opposite of that practised in the gymnasia of ancient days. The Greek of the golden age sought a harmonious education; we succeed only in producing intellectual monsters. Without the introduction of conscription, we should have fallen into complete decadence, and it is thanks to this universal military service that the fatal process has been arrested. This I regard as one of the greatest events in history. When I recall my masters at school, I realise that half of them were abnormal; and the greater the distance from which I look back on them, the stronger is my conviction that I am quite right.The primary task of education is to train the brain of the young. It is quite impossible to recognise the potential aspirations of a child of ten. In old days teachers strove always to seek out each pupil's weak point, and by exposing and dwelling on it, they successfully killed the child's self-confidence. Had they, on the contrary, striven to find the direction in which each pupil's talents lay, and then concentrated on the development of those talents, they would have furthered education in its true sense. Instead, they sought mass-production by means of endless generalisations. A child who could not solve a mathematical equation, they said, would do no good in life.

Posterity will some day come to regard them as exceedingly modest.All these demands had to be carried through, in practice against the will of the British French potentates. Now more than ever we all see it as a success of the leadership of the Third Reich that the realization of these revisions was possible for years without resort to war. This was not the case-as the British and French demagogues would have it-because we were not then in a position to wage war. When it finally appeared as though, thanks to a gradually awakening common sense, a peaceful resolution of the remaining problems could be reached through international cooperation, the agreement concluded in this spirit on September 29, 1938, at Munich by the four great states predominantly involved, was not welcomed by public opinion in London and Paris, but was condemned as a despicable sign of weakness. The Jewish capitalist warmongers, their hands covered with blood, saw in the possible success of such a peaceful revision the vanishing of plausible grounds for the realization of their insane plans.Once again that conspiracy of pitiful, corrupt political creatures and greedy financial magnates made its appearance, for whom war is a welcome means to bolster business.

This enterprise of Christianity had no more to do with religion than Marxist socialism has to do with the solution of the social problem. The notions represented by Jewish Christianity were strictly unthinkable to Roman brains. The ancient world had a liking for clarity. Scientific research was encouraged there. The gods, for the Romans, were familiar images. It is some what difficult to know whether they had any exact idea of the Beyond. For them, eternal life was personified in living beings, and it consisted in a perpetual renewal. Those were conceptions fairly close to those which were current amongst the Japanese and Chinese at the time when the Swastika made its appearance amongst them.It was necessary for the Jew to appear on the scene and introduce that mad conception of a life that continues into an alleged Beyond! It enables one to regard life as a thing that is negligible here below—since it will flourish later, when it no longer exists. Under cover of a religion, the Jew has introduced intolerance in a sphere in which tolerance formerly prevailed. Amongst the Romans, the cult of the sovereign intelligence was associated with the modesty of a humanity that knew its limits, to the point of consecrating altars to the unknown god.The Jew who fraudulently introduced Christianity into the ancient world—in order to ruin it—re-opened the same breach in modern times, this time taking as his pretext the social question. It's the same sleight-of-hand as before. Just as Saul was changed into St. Paul, Mardochai became Karl Marx.Peace can result only from a natural order. The condition of this order is that there is a hierarchy amongst nations. The most capable nations must necessarily take the lead. In this order, the subordinate nations get the greater profit, being protected by the more capable nations.It is Jewry that always destroys this order. It constantly provokes the revolt of the weak against the strong, of bestiality against intelligence, of quantity against quality. It took fourteen centuries for Christianity to reach the peak of savagery and stupidity. We would therefore be wrong to sin by excess of confidence and proclaim our definite victory over Bolshevism. The more we render the Jew incapable of harming us, the more we shall protect ourselves from this danger. The Jew plays in nature the rôle of a catalysing element. A people that is rid of its Jews returns spontaneously to the natural order.In 1925 I wrote in Mein Kampf (and also in an unpublished work) that world Jewry saw in Japan an opponent beyond its reach. The racial instinct is so developed amongst the Japanese therefore compelled to act from outside. It would be to the considered interests of England and the United States to come to an understanding with Japan, but the Jew will strive to prevent such an understanding. I gave this warning in vain. A question arises. Does the Jew act consciously and by calculation, or is he driven on by his instinct? I cannot answer that question.The intellectual élite of Europe (whether professors of faculties, high officials, or whatever else) never understood anything of this problem. The élite has been stuffed with false ideas, and on these it lives. It propagates a science that causes the greatest possible damage. Stunted men have the philosophy of stunted men. They love neither strength nor health, and they regard weakness and sickness as supreme values.Since it's the function that creates the organ, entrust the world for a few centuries to a German professor—and you'll soon have a mankind of cretins, made up of men with big heads set upon meagre bodies."},{"id":1161,"quote":"Il compito dello Stato nei confronti del capitale era perciò semplice e chiaro: esso doveva badare a che restasse il servitore dello Stato e non cercasse di diventare il padrone della Nazione.

For religious people who, in the solitude of winter, continually seek ultimate light on their religious problems with the assistance of the Bible, must eventually become spiritually deformed. The wretched people strive to extract truths from these Jewish chicaneries, where in fact no truths exist. As a result they become embedded in some rut of thought or other and, unless they possess an exceptionally commonsense mind, degenerate into religious maniacs.It is deplorable that the Bible should have been translated into German, and that the whole of the German people should have thus become exposed to the whole of this Jewish mumbo-jumbo. So long as the wisdom, particularly of the Old Testament, remained exclusively in the Latin of the Church, there was little danger that sensible people would become the victims of illusions as the result of studying the Bible. But since the Bible became common property, a whole heap of people have found opened to them lines of religious thought which—particularly in conjunction with the German characteristic of persistent and somewhat melancholy meditation—as often as not turned them into religious maniacs. When one recollects further that the Catholic Church has elevated to the status of Saints a whole number of madmen, one realises why movements such as that of the Flagellants came inevitably into existence in the Middle Ages in Germany.As a sane German, one is flabbergasted to think that German human beings could have let themselves be brought to such a pass by Jewish filth and priestly twaddle, that they were little different from the howling dervish of the Turks and the negroes, at whom we laugh so scornfully.

The more uniformly the fighting will of a people is put into action, the greater will be the magnetic force of the movement and the more powerful the impetus of the blow. It is part of the genius of a leader to make adversaries of different fields appear as always belonging to one category only, because to weak and unstable characters, the knowledge that there are various enemies will lead only too easily to incipient doubts as to their own cause.  As soon as the wavering masses find themselves confronted with too many enemies, objectivity at once steps in, and the question is raised whether actually all the others are wrong and their own nation or their own movement alone is right.  Also, with this comes the first paralysis of their own strength. Therefore, a number of essentially different enemies must always be regarded as one in such a way that in the opinion of the mass of one‘s own adherents the war is being waged against one enemy alone.

Del mismo modo que el credo religioso resulta de la educación, al paso que el sentimiento religioso duerme en lo más íntimo del ser, de la misma manera la opinión política de la masa es el resultado final del trabajo, a veces increíblemente arduo e intenso, de la inteligencia humana. La prensa es el factor responsable de mayor volumen en el proceso de la \"educación\" política, a la cual en este caso se le asigna con propiedad el nombre de propaganda; la prensa se encarga ante todo de esta labor de \"información pública\" y representa así una especie de escuela para adultos, sólo que esa \"instrucción\" no está en manos del Estado, sino bajo las garras de elementos que en parte son de muy baja ralea. Precisamente en Viena tuve en mi juventud la mejor oportunidad de conocer a fondo a los propietarios y fabricantes espirituales de esa máquina de educación colectiva. En un principio debí sorprenderme al darme cuenta del tiempo relativamente corto en que este pernicioso poder era capaz de crear un determinado ambiente de opinión, y esto incluso tratándose de casos de una mixtificación completa de las aspiraciones y tendencias que, a no dudar, existían en el sentir de la comunidad.

En esta forma, el mismo marxismo internacional no pasa de ser un punto de vista general del mundo – sostenido en verdad por espacio de muy largo tiempo – y llevado adelante por el judío Karl Marx a modo de credo político. De faltarle el apoyo de un proceso de envenenamiento semejante, el extraordinario éxito político de estas doctrinas habría sido imposible. Karl Marx fue sencillamente, y en realidad, el único individuo entre millones que en el lodazal de un mundo corrompido descubrió, con el ojo seguro del profeta, la ponzoña indispensable, extractándola como por arte de magia en una solución concentrada a fin de acelerar la destrucción de la existencia independiente de las naciones libres de esta Tierra. Y todo ello con el propósito de servir a su propia raza.En este sentido puede decirse que la doctrina marxista constituye el epítome intelectual de las teorías del mundo que prevalecen hoy en día.En esta parte del mundo la cultura humana y la civilización están indisolublemente ligadas a la presencia del elemento ario. Si ese elemento desapareciese o fuera vencido, el negro velo de un periodo de barbarie volvería a descender sobre el mundo.Para todo aquel que contemple a este último con ojos de nacionalista, cualquier brecha abierta en la existencia de la civilización humana merced a la destrucción de la raza que la protege, será siempre el más condenable de los crímenes.

La organización de una política mundial sólo podrá efectuarse, en todos los tiempos, mediante su enunciación definida y exacta; los prinicipios de un partido en formación son para éste lo que el dogma es para la religión. Por consiguiente, así como la organización del partido marxista traza actualmente el camino hacia el internacionalismo, así debe contar la política nacionalista con un instrumento que nos ofrezca una posibilidad de defenderla por la fuerza. Éste es el objetivo que persigue el Partido Nacional Socialista Obrero Alemán.Advertí, pues, que me estaba reservada la particular misión de extraer las ideas centrales de la masa informe de esta teoría general del mundo, para remodelarlas y darles una forma más o menos dogmática, de modo que por su franqueza y claridad fuera capaz de unir sólidamente a cuantos la aprobasen. En otras palabras: el Partido Nacional Socialista Obrero Alemán se propone adaptar los principios esenciales de una teoría racista del mundo a las posibilidades prácticas que nos ofrecen los tiempos y el material humano actuales, para lograr el triunfo de aquella teoría del mundo, triunfo que tendrá lugar cuando tales métodos hayan tornado posible la rígida organización de grandes masas."},{"id":1201,"quote":"Se uma doutrina que encerrasse mais inveracidade ao lado de idêntica brutalidade na propaganda, fosse oposta a social-democracia, triunfaria do mesmo modo, por mais áspera que fosse a luta."},{"id":1202,"quote":"The differences between the various peoples should not prevent us from recognizing the community of race which unites them on a higher plane."},{"id":1203,"quote":"For we do not know what type of instinct Mr. Eden has for idealistic values.

But it would be false to assume that this variety in instruction is a safeguard afainst uniformity of outlook, for although the professors of the various universities fight among themselves, they are all, fundamentally and at heart, in complete agreement. I came to realise this clearly through my contacts with the economists. This must have been about 1929. At that time we published a paper on certain aspects of the economic problem. Immediately a whole company of national economists of all sorts, and from a variety of universities, joined forces and signed a circular in which they unaminously condemned our economic proposals. I made one attempt to have a serious discussion with one of the most renowned of them, and one who was regarded by his colleagues as a revolutionary in economic thought Zwiedineck. The results were disastrous!At the time the State had floated a loan of two million seven hundred thousand marks for the construction of a road. I told Zwiedineck that I regarded this way of financing a project as foolish in the extreme. The life of the road in question would be some fifteen years ; but the amortisation of the capital involved would continue for eighty years. What the Government was really doing was to evade an immediate financial obligation by transferring the charges to the men of the next generation and, indeed, of the generation after. I insisted that nothing could be more unsound, and that what the Government should really do was to take radical steps to reduce the rate of interest and thus to render capital more fluid.I next argued that the gold standard, the fixing of rates of exchange and so forth were shibboleths which I had never regarded and never would regard as weighty and immutable principles of economy. Money, to me, was simply a token of exchange for work done, and its value depended absolutely on the value of the work accomplished. Where money did not represent services rendered, I insisted, it had no value at all.Zwiedineck was horrified and very excited. Such ideas, he declared, would upset the accepted economic principles of the entire world, and the putting of them into practice would cause a breakdown of the world's political economy.When, later, after our assumption of power, I put my theories into practice, the economists were not in the least discountenanced, but calmly set to work to prove by scientific argument that my theories were, indeed, sound economy !"},{"id":1208,"quote":"No hay medio al que no recurra un tal delincuente moral para alcanzar sus objetivos.
